They said that they were lost for a few hours and they didn't know where their hotel was. The kids are I tied them I tied their their boat to my thing and I tried to go fast but they like were tipping into the water so I had to go really really slow like the speed of a paddle boat. It was very very annoying. I finally got I got to their hotel. I let them loose and everybody there in the hotel is like, "Wow, where do you find them? We're looking. There's a search and rescue and a whole thing." And to get out of there semi to show off to them and semi because I was very annoyed. I floored it. It's like this guy this and I had like one of the fastest ones you could buy. It turbocharged the whole thing. I got out of there and a minute later, woo, it's never happened. Like on the water like lights and sirens, the whole thing. He pulls me over. He says, "What are you crazy? You're doing 70 m an hour in in a wake zone." I said, "Officer, you don't understand. There's a woman and her daughter. They're missing and I'm I'm searching for them." So, so he's like, he's like, "I know all about it, but why you going 70 mi?" I said, "They're going to die. Who knows what? I don't know." Like, he didn't get the they didn't let him know yet. That okay, go, but you know, got to take it easy. I said, "Okay, officer. See you later."

So this those parents that lost that kid had a this is the granddaughter beautiful mazd monthly who's here on Friday. It was unbelievable. We just walked in here. What? >> Oh, that's why he's having a at his house tonight. We're going to learn a sug that's not traumatic at all, but some people when they hear some of these words, they get traumatized. So, I guarantee you, you're not going to be traumatized when we're done. When there's two types of food that are the same food, they are the same exact food there. It has one when you mix those two foods together. And when there's two different foods, it has a different. So, let's let's just an example of two foods that are the same. If you have uh beef, cow beef that's kosher and cow beef that's non-coosher. It's roadkill. Somebody killed the cow up north. You take the meat and you put it in. Is that the same Is that the same type of food, Raba? Yes or no? Huh? You guys are hesitant. Why are you hesitant? >> Yes. By the way, I learned a new thing. Me and my wife, we learned in Utah, they don't say yeah. They say yes. It's a thing. It makes a big you'll when you hear it like what's going on here. Yes. Everything is yes. There's no they don't have that word. >> Where in London there's no Yeah. >> Ah. Yes. In in in England also it's yes. It takes time. You you know you know what he's talking about. >> You know about the Yeah. Yes. You know you know the Yes. Okay. >> Yeah. Is kind of lazy. You're saying it's not proper. Okay. Listen. England, they had it right. They had it first, so they know what they're doing. Okay. So, that's called min biminoi. It's the same thing. What about uh a dead mouse and beef? Is that minimino? Is that the same thing? No. How do you say no in England? Okay. Good. Good. Good. You want to make sure maybe it's not proper to say no. You have to say it in ad. Okay. How about yay and regular wine? Is that miminoi? >> Yes. How about grape juice and grapes? Is that miminoi? >> Everybody says no. >> Who says? Who would you say is? You're right. What's the purpose for it? >> How about two types of vinegar that are made from different things completely? One is made from beer or one is made from wine. Is that >> why do you say that? >> Oh. Oh, so that we're going to get to he's right knows this stuff. This stuff. Well, I mean, he knows his stuff, but he's he's a there's certain people. He's a in this thing. >> He's not allowed to answer. >> He's not allowed to answer. >> There's a there's a there's a that says if the name even though this is that they're both vinegar, even though they're from different things, great. Now when it's minim when it's the same thing mixed then even a small very very small amount of non-cooser beef that falls into a chunk pot it's gone finished. If it's two different types if it's a mouse with a big giant p of chunk let's say it falls into the chunk. So then it's bottle. It It's nice and t it goes by the flavor. Okay. The the flavor. And if you cannot you don't know how to discern the flavor. So we say it's one out of 60 60. So if there's 60 times more chunk than the mouse, which usually there there is in a larger pot, then you're allowed to eat the ch. That's because it's what? It's min. Basically all we're doing today is is is is four things. We're talking about minimino is this it's the same food two two of the same you know minim it's the it's the opposite and then you have no tam it it gives flavor it doesn't give flavor and giving flavor if we don't know what it is we do one in 60 and then you have the other thing is called mashu it's even a a minor amount that's it I think repeats it over and over so it becomes very very simple and easy Huh? >> A solid or a liquid? >> Oh, no. You going to start up with me now. >> Solid and liquids. We're not getting into it today. Okay. So, says the gumar all the way in the top. Aged wine together with grapes. What is that? aged wine. 50 year old wine with grapes. Is it minim? What is it? >> It's not the same thing. Why? This has one flavor and grapes have another flavor. So if it's not the same thing, then how much do we use to be matalate? How much? >> You need one of 60. So you're you're it's much less. It's not a mashu. You could pour in a whole bottle of wine. If you have 59 bottles that are kosher, if a whole bottle of non-cooser wine falls in, we're not talking about really, but because that's different of it. The zar is different, but if a bottle of non-cosher wine mixes with 59 other bottles of kosher wine, bottle grapes, >> grapes. Okay, I'm just Yeah, I'm throwing it out. >> Yeah, you're right. >> Correct. Good chilus. It's a good chila. >> No, because >> No, the no the idea is nice and Tom. The idea is it gives flavor if you don't know what it is. So they they did some sort of uh report and they went and they taste it comes out that after 60 it doesn't give flavor. If it gives off a flavor then it's no good. The point is less than Tom giving a flavor. A lot of us can't can't we can't we we're not good at this. So they gave us a one out of 60 not wine and wine wine with grapes. Then it's one out of 60. Or if you could if you could taste it. What if it's brand new grapes? >> Wine. Wine. brand new wine with grapes. In other words, grape juice that just came out of the grape tastes exactly like a grape. Now, what do we do? So, for this we have a it's either a very minute amount or one out of 60. Why? And the explains very today. We go by the flavor says abaya. What's the flavor? Grapes and grape juice equal the same same flavor. Here, where's that? Uh, this is the video I wanted to show you on Friday. I show you now. Jonathan Stern from London. You know him? >> I showed it in English. I saw it in Hebrew. >> In English, >> no, I showed it on a little piece. I didn't show the whole thing. I remember this thing. Look, my bad memory. [Music] It's all a rec. It's not done professionally, but Jonathan Ste took it. So good. First, you got to get the stems out. Look at this. You have all these little pieces of of uh branches in there. See that? Boom. So, that comes out. And you wouldn't believe how much of that is in there. Here. Look at that. Unbelievable. A lot of branches and stems. Then they separate the grapes from that. Now we can start pressing them. Makes you want to drink wine. Not really. >> Oh, here. It's like grape juice. Looks like a grape to me. >> Huh? [Music] [Music] Get the idea. Where is this in I think right? >> Oh sterns filming footage at the previous tower in San Jos. >> We didn't start the uh >> wine tour winery in Israel. Ter is enough everybody. [Applause] Oh, that's what we want to do. We want to also step on grapes. Fine. You got the idea. So now says it goes by the flavor. So this juice that came out of the grapes tastes like a grape. So what is that called? It's the same item. It's the same food. What's the So, a little tiny bit of bad gra bad bad grape juice together with grapes would ruin everything. No, it's one out of 60. You could go much higher. Why? Go by the name. One is a grape and one is grape juice. Different things. One is a juice, one is a grape. It's two different things. And you should know that since they're two different things, then we go by the flavor. And since we don't know what the flavor is, so we're going to call it one out of 60. What about our Mishna? Says in the Mishna, so you wash it off. So what's the Mishna talking about? Are we talking about grape juice that fell on the on the grapes or we talking about Oh, we have a video here. I forgot to show it to you. I have a question. I'm going to ask the a question about this video. [Music] Now, we need a little violin. [Music] Okay, now I'm I'm I'm being serious here. I got a about this video. If anybody feels for real, if anybody in this room feels that this video should not be shown, raise your hand for real. Okay. Who else? >> No. celebrating Zionism. >> What? >> What? >> That's not what he said. >> He said this guy came over to me. He was very serious. He's a big part of the year. He told me that he doesn't think it's appropriate to show Trump and BB in middle of a huh backand >> backhand. That's the problem. Okay. But he's a guy. >> Fine. Seriously, I'm not joking. So if somebody feels you could write me an email. You could also write it to nivgati.com. >> Whatever. I'm serious. I want to know. I don't have I don't I don't have the sensitivity. I'm missing a little bit of the sensitivity. He's more sensitive and he he was very serious. He took his time to tell me and explain to me why we should not show such videos. I didn't get it exactly. I saw my friends. He said, "No, if I carried good." Okay, BB. And do you see anything in problem with it? >> Again to make sure. [Laughter] [Music] I have a car to slave to both of them, by the way. Me personally, I have a car to leave to both of them. Okay. >> Biden. >> Yeah. >> If I told you who it is, you're not going to believe you. Fall out of your seat. Not going to say who it is, though. What? No, I was just saying to be more serious. I was trying to get the island to be. [Laughter] Okay. Anyway, so we go back to our Mishna. How do we learn the Mishna? We have a case like this. This the video falls on top of grapes. Now, is the mission referring to older wine or new wine? You could say that's talking about brand new grape juice that just came out of the grape together with grapes. And if it's we're talking about grape juice and and grapes and it says in our mission we're talking about what's the it doesn't say it's >> it's oh wait a minute says it makes sense that will prove it in a second. It's not meaning that according to would be a problem. Now this is a cash from our missions. It's nice and you get one one in 60 not a says but had a half. What's the amino says I'll tell you. Hold on. >> Says only here this is the from the fact that it says here's the rule. If it gives off a flavor, it's also the continuation of this story in the Mishna. The Mishna gives the rule and it says if it doesn't give off a flavor, it's in other words. If it's one out of 60, it's if the if that's the rule on that case, then obviously the mission is talking about one out of 60 and not okay. So, we have a problem with the bay. So says, "Who told you that the Mish is talking about grape juice and grapes? We're talking about old wine and grapes and therefore it's and that's why it goes you're right." And the rule is one out of 60 when it's how much is it? But the problem is the mission says we go with nice and we go with one out of 60. So is going to say yes. The mission does talk about One part we know for sure. We're talking about the noise and time. It's one out of 60. So he's just going to fix the He's not going to fix. He's going to explain what spilled on these grapes, a different min. And that's why it's one out of 60. It was the same min. It would be a mashu. That's all we have in the sug today. It's the same minim. Doesn't say what kind of wine spilled on it. It could be wine that's an hour old, which is grape juice. And it's the same thing as a grape. So it's minim or as is going to explain no it's old wine it'sic it's 1947 together with grapes it's two different minim then the shear is how much one out of 60 now that's a new thing now we're going to have a a reverse situation we discussed it also I I just want to throw this out because I I thought it was fascinating you go to the rv or you don't go to the RV. You open up the and you see that if it's one out of 60, it's bottle bottle. So you eat whatever you eat. I don't know what the ch whatever it is. Is there any place to be m and throw out the ch or give it to the guy? Listen, there's a little is here and I'm relying on on some sort of b. Maybe I shouldn't eat the ch. What do you guys say? >> You say no. No, no. So the our people, the very >> chicken with the >> Oh, so you're saying I hear what you're saying. So that also I saw it's interesting because so there are those who say if it's not a big maybe sell it, get rid of it. Don't why why get yourself into problems? But then the Ram comes along and says no there's no to be says says he says and it's not means that you have a suff but if this is the is that there's a that this amount in this amount is gone so it's a he says and the says he brings a thing here that it says in the of he says it's it's better when you know the you worked hard you know the it's more than being something you shouldn't be those who say it's also to be it's like a precursor it means that you don't believe in the gar the gar says this bottle don't be don't be a bigger sadic and there's a big so like we have there's a says we have enough we have enough a and enough things in our tire we don't need another if this is motor it's But there are those who say that it's okay. What >> sky? >> But those who say I'm just saying there are it goes both ways. And kids are >> they talk about everything. What? >> Oh, if it's me, it's Mia. Yeah, 100%. I wouldn't need something with the dead mouse in it. You're right. 100%. >> What? There's a real story with the cat fell into the ch the whole thing. No. It wasn't nice in town. No, it was nice and talented. It's mass. That's That's what we're talking about. It's what we're talking about. >> Okay. Now, we'll see what the ble is talking about ch I'm probably going to forget this. I was just saying now. And I said the joke before, but a guy was like, but it's not a joke. It's em like somebody was trying to to figure out the recipe of a certain ch. We remember abaloo ch and he lives here on on delay. This guy made a ch in Chicago. Abush the whole the shaw the um what is it called when people u buy the amount of people that are part of the sh tripled since the members the membership of Israel I'm not kidding tripled since he started making sh yeah people started coming from all over they became part been diving forever yeah it's a great ch I try to imitate the ch at my Thursday night cheer back then I bought the pot but he gave me a whole lesson how to do it impossible so many people try impas one guy tried to to to imitate not his ch somebody else's chunk and it didn't go it didn't go and finally he found out the guy says let me ask you how did you wash the pot he says how pot that's the problem you wash the pot you idiot you're not supposed to wash the pot it's from you week to week it's the whole you wash the pot it's nice and time it gives a little flavor we're going to talk about it soon okay it's not a This there's a lot of ems to it. I'm not kidding. >> Picking duck. They said that there's a very famous how many years old cherry one place old cooking for over 100 years. The same thing. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> Wash it lightly. Like a little bit of water. You got to leave. What's the matter? You don't like this? >> It's MS. The stuff is okay. >> Okay. So, here we go. Rabbi, the coming 50 minutes. You have two types of vinegar. One is from wine, one is from beer. What was the best thing that ever happened from co besides the whole she the growing? Yeah. But in in gashmas sourdough >> sourdough. >> Very good. Sourdough. >> So anybody that knows about sourdough, you have to have a starter. >> The starter from the wheat and the starter from barley. Two different things, two different brius, but they're both called starter. So here we have two things that they have the same name like goes by the name. So here it goes. Here's the So if they both get mixed in the two starters or the two vinegars do we go by because what it's both they're both vinegar. So a little bit of this tray vinegar. We were in PES in my uncle's going to kill me. But it was our family program and we have mim and everything. It's just our family. We're not trying to make money. We're just trying to have kosher food. In middle of pes they found out that one of the vinegars is misht. You know it's a problem. A lot of food that we made. So here you have imisher is different. I'm not we're not going to go into hums now, but it's an idea that this this vinegar is tra and this vinegar is not and a little tiny drop fell in. So if you say it's the same exact thing because they have the same name, boom, it's gone. If not, it's one out of 60. It's now the says why is here explains everything for kindergarten. Nice. Why flavor? You go by the flavor, not by the name of this product. This is made from wine. It has one taste. Made out of out of beer. It has a different flavor. So, it's two different things. You get one out of six. No. You know what? They're both called vinegar. [Music] They're both called starters. So two starters got mixed in. They're both the same. What's the same? I know that I go by the flavor. Let's say you have three different spices. Here we go. But they have the same name. They're both all three are pill. Okay. White pepper, whatever. Pepper, white pepper, red pepper. >> Last ingredient for my delicious soup is pepper, >> black pepper, and white pepper. [Music] >> Listen, you don't ask any cashes on AI. So, the three together created something here. three different types of spices. They get together to make it here because they're all trying all three are trying to make this thing sweet. They're able to make it sweet. They make it they make this uh this food sweet. If we go with the flavor, you're right. If we go by flavor says look it makes sense all three come to do one thing great but we go by the name especially in the second case here where he took three different types of spices some say it even even on the first case cuz one is black pepper one is white pepper you see you don't go by the name you go by the flavor no not a good because that whole price is going according to one sheet of start This is a crazy. If you take a half of his eyes oft and put it together with half of his eyes of and put it together, boom, the guy was because he took a half of his eyes and half of his eyes together, it's how do you know that over here also you take three spices, they're all no good. Did they come to do that? Says it's not good. But it's next case. If I pour vinegar into wine, is that two different things? Vinegar into wine. So certainly since it's we go by the flavor by imparts flavor. What is that? One out of 60. This is a super interesting case. What if I pour wine into vinegar here like this. I pour wine into vinegar. So Rashi says when you pour wine into vinegar it becomes vinegar in midair says Rashi which is hard to understand but that's what he says. Basically it loses its aroma in midair and becomes it it smells like like vinegar. So now we have a new Shila here. When when you talk about you hear this when we talk about does it go by the smell or goes by the product? Do we view this wine here? Let's just see it in midair here. One second. The mid ear. It goes from the red aroma to like yellow to vinegar aroma. >> But it tastes like wine but it smells like vinegar. So do we go by the smell or do we go by the taste? That's the Shila. Who wants to volunteer? I have uh I have two candies I want to do a I want to do a test on. I don't know if it's going to work. Anybody want to volunteer? >> Come. Why not? Get over here. You made a shak. Make a sh. >> What could go wrong? What go? You're a little bit too big to fit into the screen. That's the only problem. >> Who else? I need another volunteer. Come. You just go. >> Okay. This is the only But seriously. No, no, no. Be. No. I'm not I'm not doing it. They're sweet. There were candy. It's a lolli. Two lollies. But you have to I I tried it. It didn't work. You have to just play along. Pretend it works. You have to close your eyes. You have to promise you're not going to peek. And close your nose. So, we're trying to see if Here's what's going on. How many flavors could your tongue taste? >> Regular person. >> Regular person. Five flavors. Only only five things. >> Salt. umami, >> sugar, bitter and uh >> like like savory and maybe but to make it the distinction between watermelon and strawberry that the tongue can't do. It's only through the nose. In other words, the nose maybe is responsible for 90% of what we taste. That's what they say. Check it out. I did a little research. So, here you ready? You got to close your eyes. Close. I'm not going to It's not going to be gross. Close your eyes and your nose. You ready? Tell me what you're doing. No. No. But you can't peek. No peeking. I want you to tell me what flavor each one is. Hold on. I'm going to give you different lollies. You're not going to You're not going to taste the same one. Maybe this is different. Okay. What should we do first? Um, the imam is the same. Hold on. Okay, guys. Ready here. Close your nose. Okay, putting it in eyes though. >> And eyes. Yeah, you too. Here you go. >> Okay, take it out. Don't look. Don't look. Don't look. Take it out. You're looking. Don't look. >> You ready? There we go. Close your mouth. Close your mouth. Close your hand. Okay. Was it hard to f Was it hard? What do you got? >> It's a little sweeter than I don't know. But >> first one was lemon. That's for sure. >> I didn't taste the first one. The second one was >> Second one. >> Was what was the second one? You can open your eyes now. >> Was apple, I think. The second one was apple. >> Second one was cotton candy. And the first one was was lemon lime, I think. >> Yeah, lemon. >> You couldn't taste the cotton candy. I wanted to get two sweet ones. I didn't have >> very very like almost fruity, but like like a Yeah. >> But anyways, did they make a difference there? Taste them. No, this is his passing around the whole room. >> Okay. >> Anyways, the point is Yeah. Corona. When you can't taste, you can't smell. Maybe I I don't know if it had to do with the tongue as much as that do with the nose, right? >> What happened? >> Yeah, that's >> Yeah, I gave the guy I gave the guy apple and onion. It didn't work. It didn't work. I want to see if it will work. Okay. So now you hear the sha you have wine that doesn't smell like wine. It smells like vinegar. So now you can finish his. I don't know which one is what. Here. You can have both. >> Oh, you have the same one. >> That is the weirdest thing. Not I did not know that he brought it and I didn't get it from him. I had my own bag. Right. Isn't that weird? That's a That's a That's That's a Chicago brothers cuz I had a bag full of crazy amount. Seriously. >> From Rafie and >> Oh, Rafie and Chul. I had a whole bag. No, that's crazy that he brought the same flavor. It's weird. And two here. You can have Where's That is weird. Mom is strange. We've seen Stranger Things in the D, but that's that's a strange one. He pulls out his pocket. The same exact lolli. Okay. Anyway, and these are like from two years ago. I found them like in a place that says, I'm not kidding. It was next to the paint. Ask my wife. So says, we got to go. We only have four minutes. And the Israelis are starting to pack in here. Oh, we have a small They both smell like vinegar, but one is wine and one is vinegar. So we have and goes through the whole thing again. [Music] when it smells like vinegar but it tastes like like wine then it goes so it's vinegar what does say based on this little why did I do this whole thing because since smell is one of the most important things in taste more important than the actual taste buds that we have then he says it goes by the smell and the smell is vinegar so it's mimi But says no. No, no, no. We go by the that it's that it's wine and therefore wine and vinegar is two different you go one out of 60. Great. By the way, I have to say because Ariel is here and I want to say this before and nobody nobody forced me to say this, but I have to say it's tremendous. Tariel and to Kobe and to Shimmy. Shimmy I think is also here tonight. I saw him somewhere. Where is he? He's all the way in the back corner. While I was gone, it was it's harder to do the editing when I'm gone. Different hours, different things. So, tremendous to them and to all the guys to Dave. Where's Dave? Dave and Gary, whoever was here in the Bish to to show the videos and to to do everything. There's a lot of a lot of work that goes on behind the scenes. And of course, Marshinazi did a tremendous, tremendous amount of work until that dreadful. Unbelievable. I told you already. I'll say it again. My wife says, "You have to call Mark immediately." Mati Chavez. Now, Mati Shabas in Utah is 9:45. Shears at 10:00. Never did I ever I never had so so few minutes to to prepare. And 10:00 there here in Utah is like 7:00 here. Like 15 20 minutes just to get everything together. Kids are you got to call Mark. Emergency. Call Mark. Hi. Um, I won't be able to to do the shir for seven days. Like I'm thinking like he broke his leg. What happened? Like I'm all of a sudden he said seven like he's quiet. And then I had to like with him for 5 minutes. So that took five minutes out of the 15. You know what I'm saying? Okay. just just sharing with you because the Israelis are here and we have to do an om. Oh, sponsors you were turning the daff global MD enjoying the benefit of meers of MDY clients. Anonymous anonymous like three sponsorships for Mark's father. Beautiful. We have to ask him. We have to get all the data. How many people actually came? How many people sent him text? It's it's a lot. One minute. What did I miss here? O. Wow. I missed a lot. Really? Seriously? Because we went through this here. Mimbeino. [Applause] >> I'm looking for roadkill. >> Hold on. And then comes offer. This is Mimi. So it's 1 to 59, right? Worms and tequila go. So isuino is 90. Okay, this we did um Oh, okay. Here we go. One more. Uh time I said this. Hi Bastio. So this is Bastia. There's um a little hole in the barrel that people would smell. Professionals would come smell to see if it's good. So it's kosher wine. It's owned by Jew. Can the guy smell it? I don't see a reason why not. It's okay. But is this okay? This is 100% wine. Can a Jew smell it? Oh, so this is something I read a long time ago, but look it up. You'll see it's I think everybody knows this, should know it, that when you smell something, you smell a dirty diaper, basically particles from the dirty diaper going into your nose. You smell a dead person, it's part of the dead person is in your in your body. It's very small, very minute, but it that's what it is. That's what a smell is. So what what he's saying is it's it's a milsa. It's something is >> so so if if you can make a on it that's for different reason maybe but over here you it's it's going to your body you shouldn't be putting in your body so he says it's also >> it's like za it's like fumes >> huh >> it's like za it's like fumes >> za >> za is something else is more like not a good thing but yeah but it's no fumes I don't know what it is maybe it is yeah if you smell it that means part of it is there >> part of the particles of that whatever you smelling is in your nose. It's not like transmission. It's not like waves. This is real. It's like real particles you can put in a microscope and see them. Smells nothing. In other words, this is insignificant. I'll prove it to you. It's not true. If you use a certain how do you say it in English human you take human which is in everything in Israel in the falafel and I don't know what >> in the rugal rug human rugal human lollies and jelly beans. So you take that. No, no, no. I'm not like that. I wouldn't do that to you, but it's it's it's awesome for to eat this. Why? Because it's you baked bread in it. Now it has a cumin flavor. It's only the smell, the the aroma of the cumin, not the actual cumin. And you're allowed to benefit from Truma. You're not allowed to eat truma. Be allowed to smell trauma. So you smell trum. No, that's not a good over there. Cumin was burnt out. Now you're what you're left with. You're not you're not with the original. You just have the smell that's in the air somewhere. This is like now this rabbis will sees the worst of the worst. Hot loaf of bread with an aroma of wine. There's no chance for the Roman not to go in to penetrate the bread because it's hot. If the bread is cold, then there's a shakus. If the if the if the barrel is closed, but if the barrel is open and you have a hot loaf of bread, by the way, when you smell a nice hot loaf of bread, that means part of the bread went to your your nostrils. If the bread is made out of barley, then it's saucer. It's like a vacuum cleaner. Grabs everything into it, but not the wheat. Do we care about of course the the aroma goes into the bread, but do we care about the or not? Says holds that it's nothing. Smell is nothing. So then how come there's that says this is a smell is nothing. So obviously this is obviously whether or not smell something but that says perhaps explains why goes through it for two lines. The worst of the worst hot bread open barrel then it's awesome. If the bread is completely cold and the barrel is covered, it's closed. Then there's no penetration at all. If the bread is hot, but the and the barrel is closed or a cold piece of bread and cold bread and a and an open barrel, then we have a says, "But me, what's me?" This case right over here. Where is it? Yeah, this case. What is that like? You have a human being that's inhaling it like a like a like a vacuum cleaner. The the barrel is wide open spewing out the fumes. So, obviously, it's going to be awesome. Have a wonderful week. Have a wonderful day. All the guests are coming. >> Merit the of spreading Torah throughout the world.
