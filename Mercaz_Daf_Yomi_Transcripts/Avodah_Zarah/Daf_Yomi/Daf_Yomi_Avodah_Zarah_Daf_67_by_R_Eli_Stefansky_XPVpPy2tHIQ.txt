Some some of these yeshivas instead of the buck walking around the block a personal message from my moha. He asked that I give over that as the official night to magir which is myself. He says it's only fear and appropriate that you show up in person once in a while for seder.

What's truly inspiring how many hundreds of MD wires visited, called or messaged me. Israel. So I wrote back to him. I said, "Give me like one story of somebody that uh that came from far or whatever." I didn't realize it's going to be a whole there. Check this out. Michael Chessel flew from to and from Hollywood just to sit with me for an hour. Morty Spiro flew to and from Chicago just to sit with me. I was there when he came.

Guys from all over Jersey, Muny, KJ, Manhattan, five towns, Queens and Brooklyn to Barak, Williamsburg, Flatbush, Kitser, he said it's going to take him all to to write back to all the people. Now, one one thing I got to tell you a couple things. One of the crazy stories they told me at Shiva and it's crazy not so much on said fine, but this the story a beautiful weekend. Imagine beautiful in in somewhere in some fancy hotel. Kassan and Kyle get stuck on the highway. They had to get off by Marshinazi's parents and stay there for shabas. Hundreds of guests at the I was just like I don't know what happened to that couple today where they are today. Maybe they have 8:00 already. Who knows? That was one thing. And then another one he said they said uh Mark was telling me that a couple had to be in the hospital for months. She had to be in bed rest in the hospital. Then the baby was born early niku for months. All those months the father was in their house and then many years later when his father was just nifer needed medical attention that baby that was in the niku was the one who's there he's a pa and he didn't administer the IV or whatever mdy month later again. So, oh yeah. What is this? Somebody gave me a gift. The belly sleeper. I should open it up. No, I see what it is. But we'll learn. We'll learn eventually. Where are we going to put this? MDY is going to buy me a new house with long walls so I could hang all these things up. I'm sure my wife wants this somewhere. Oh, it's a painting. It's not real even. This is a painting. >> Wow, >> that's incredible. >> Yeah, >> this is a painting. Bam. They won't. You won't tell. You said it's uh >> says anonymous. They don't want They don't I can know, but I can't tell you. >> Read the card. >> Let's see. Read the card. What? >> 2711. You're the iron man of Tyra Mazum and changing many more thousands of lives. May you always go from the name. Okay. Say the name. >> I can't say the name. >> You can say the name. I could say the name. You sure? Yumo Dav Bazara, age 10, Baltimore, Maryland. So, what's an original? I don't It looks like all this is all art. Okay, I'll have Look at my hand over here. >> It's >> This isn't the original. There's a paint. >> There's a paint. >> Oh, maybe. >> I'm not supposed to say it. Okay, >> take it out. >> It's too late now. It's on 25 things. >> It's not my fault. You ruined. What does it say? Typo. It says no typo. So, it's his fault. He made a typo. Okay. Sorry. I tried. Even when I try, it slips. Look at him. Okay. Rab boy says, "Here we go. We're done with the We're in the non-traumatic suga. We learned about Yeah, we'll get the guest on. Remind me. Remind me. It's already 7:30. 20 minutes. Wow. Okay, that's more than enough time for today's daf. Today we're learning a new thing. Yesterday we discussed a lot about minim. So you already started what is nice and tam is if we don't know right there's a mashu that ruins a whole uh tapel a whole thing of food but there's also another thing called how much is remembers 160th today we're going to learn this idea called that's basically today's the reason why a A lot of people when when you see natal pagam I'm going to ask the Sanhedrin when mashia comes like to get rid of all the crazy rashas it's just confusing we have enough ink we have paper it's fine it looks scary but it's nice and what does it mean very very simple if the food imparts this tra stuff imparts a terrible flavor that's not good for the food we're going to pass in today that it's the food is kosher. So in other words, let's say you cooked meat in a pot and the pot is more than a day old and then you cook milk in it. It's not a problem. Why? Because the flavor that comes out of the pot into the milk is already a day old. It's disgusting. It's old meat and that's nice and tam. It's giving bad flavor to the milk. So it shouldn't make the milk. I'm not passing anything. I'm just telling you what we're learning today. Shouldn't make the tapel. So that's what we're learning today. Says we learned in the Mishna. It's four lines from the top of when the food imparts a good flavor >> then it makes it trafe and if it imparts a bad flavor it's kosher and the Mishna gives an example for instance if you have beans or some sort of greasin barley beans whatever it is and you pour vinegar on it like pouring vinegar into your ch so it's going to give it a terrible flavor so even though the vinegar is tra the ch is kasher why because it imparted a terri flavor. So now we have a little bit of a freebie like 10 lines that repeats itself a bunch of times. So we're going to see four or five that tell you that when you impart a bad flavor the food is kosher here. This is keep on going. This one says it's motor. This one says it's motor. Everybody says it's motor. Okay, do me a favor. Once you up there, unplug that perfume thing. It's driving me crazy. It's you're right. So says that if it gives a bad flavor, it's kosher. And now just an explanation. When does it give it a bad flavor? When these greasen these beans, this barley, whatever it is, is boiling. It's hot. So you can imagine when you put you introduce some flavor into something hot, it gets absorbed. But if it's if it's cold and then you heated it up. So first thing if these greas are cold and you introduce vinegar, it makes the greasin good. What what just hit my head is like arbus on a Friday night. Arbus. So you add you got to add some spice to it otherwise has it doesn't taste like anything. So you add a little bit of vinegar. Why is that not pepper vinegar? It's if it's cold makes it good. So what if you introduce a bunch of vinegar to the be to the arabus and then you put it on the the stove and you you cook it. Now, if it's hot and you put the the vinegar, that ruins the flavor. >> But what if you put it when it's cold and then you heat it up? It's too late. That we saw a bunch of times that if something's when it's cold and you add the vinegar, it makes it good. So, just because you heated it up and you and you and you boiled it doesn't make it better. You can't get rid of the then it's like as if you made it good, then you made it bad. It's too late. It is good. We're going to look at it as if you made it good. And this is remains in it. And it's aer just explains why does it say NASA? NASA. What's NASA? NASA means. No, I'm not looking for that. NASA. It should. What the GR should say is it is it's great. Not NASA. NASA means it's as if. It's not as if it's great. Vinegar for cold is good. So T says it's something very simple like arabus you we could understand it. If you take something raw and you pour vinegar in it doesn't do anything to it. If you take something and you boil it up and then you cool it down then you introduce the vinegar that's cold that you introduce vinegar. So says tis what's really good is if you would have boiled it cooled it off introduce vinegar. But over here you introduce the vinegar before you boiled it. You just put it to to when it's cold. Then it's as if it was boiled, cooled down, and introduced the vinegar. So it's only as if fine. Sorry, I might have skipped something. So if I go back to my chart over here, we have we have right here. No, somebody else [Music] same exact thing. He's not repeat just repeating. It's when the vinegar hits the hot grease and then it it gets absorbed and therefore it's a bad flavor. Bad flavor equals kosher. If you put it in the cold and cold it it adds good flavor and only afterwards you boil it up again same it was good then bad remains here this is I don't know okay this is this is a food that they used to eat in they would take greasin and add the the vinegar to it and it was a good food throughout. So we have crest crest that would introduce vinegar to the crest and eat it like that. This is not shakim. This is greasing with vinegar just for Irish covered Irish abuses. So they asked this kid that was struggling with the kkite. Well, what's your trauma? Every kid has a trauma. Everybody has a story. So he said a trauma that we can relate to it, but grad here in this year it's very hard to relate to but people can relate to it. He said because of Shabas in my house was a disaster because of Shab my parents used to fight like crazy yelling and screaming in the the pressure for Shabas. So that's why we have a she at 2:30 here of Shabas. All the men show up here. They love it. I actually extend it supposed to be over with an hour. We do hour and a half. Two hours sometimes doesn't go home. I don't know why they all sit here. They do. Oh, it's we help. We take trauma. There's a lot of We fix traumas. There's different ways to fix trauma. We get rid of the traumas. This is important. This word this that you you add bad flavor to to food that they said. So let me just explain to you about it's super simple. Here we got a mimish amino. We have a tapsel. Okay. Now they're tasting. These are chefs. They're tasting what's going on here. And one guy says example cuz it's a full >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's not a good example. >> Why take it out there? >> Hold on. Hold on. Exactly. >> For the for the for the it's it's >> a lot of the things are not a good example. >> They also one of the worst things they did with their hand. They should have used the fork. Okay. >> One guy says it's too salty. The other guy says we don't have salt. It's too too sharp. Too >> spicy. >> Fine. Too spicy. Now obviously this mouse like the mice of where the cat fell into the ch and yeshiva the mice ma the cat fell into the ch right what yeshiva the cat fall into the ch say povich >> they say panovich >> pretend they ch >> ever since then they have in this they messed up the whole yeshiva >> so does the cat impart a bad flavor if You have a mouse and a ch. It's going to impart a mousy flavor. So here's the shil. It's a beautiful Shiloh. The the cha before before the mouse fell in was bad. Look all the chefs. This guy says it's too salty. This guy says it's too this, do that. So the the ch is off. Some guy decided to to do the ch instead of his wife and he doesn't know what he's doing, right? >> So now you have you have a mouse slash too salty. How do we view it? Is it nice? Is the mouse nice and is the mouse imparting bad flavor? It's already bad beforehand. So there's two ways to look at it. You could say, you could say means the mouse does does nothing. It's not a it's not a bad flavor. What? It's going to be you have a mouse in a ch. The only time mouse and ch is good is if it imparts a bad flavor, a negative flavor. But over here it's already negative beforehand. So didn't impart a bad flavor. We remain with the mouse mouse ch is that's the I could say the same exact thing and say no I don't care about the salt I don't care about this there's I smell I taste a dead mouse in here and dead mouse is gam is mut so it's mut means the child is good means the child is no good very very simple here says these two it's not He says it's not it's not considered that the mouse imparts a bad flavor and ought to have a mousy so it's awesome. He says no the mouse does impart a bad flavor. So it's if it's pum if it's a disgusting flavor in the ch then the ch is let's see inside this what they said that it gives a bad flavor it's without the this food being bad if the food is bad then we have a problem it's missing salt right the famous famous story with he He was at a a place I think it might have been on Shabas. I don't remember what day of the week it was. He was at a place with another of and the balabas of the hotel came by and said new what do you think about the food and the issue was missing a little salt and when the balas went away I don't know if it was a woman or whatever it was told the person I can't believe you says who works here in this hotel who could come on on a shab is like this person doesn't have a husband an alman So, so what happened? She's going to go now, turn around, go back into the kitchen and yell at her and say, you know, the said that the food wasn't good, was missing salt. The guy says, you know, you're exaggerating. You made a whole, you know, you're making you made. They saying yeshiva, you made you ask, don't make it's a man and then he's fine and nobody's yelling. So, they said, okay, let's go. So they went into the kitchen and they they found this the balabos yelling at the almano the mono was crying famous story. Yeah. Oh sorry can't miss any words there is missing salt has too much salt tablet is missing spice too much spice. All these are problems with the food. The food is not good. Doesn't taste good. Too much salt. What are you going to do with too much salt? The only time you say that it ruins the choser is if you don't have a side problem with salt and the the different spices. But if you have a problem with salt and different spices, then we have to be and say that the ch is tra because I don't regard the mouse at all. It's a mousy ch. It has a mouse in there and we don't say And some say the opposite. The same case. I don't care if it's missing salt and has too much salt. Bottom line is in addition to the very salty ch I have a mousy ch and that mousy ch I don't care now about the mouse because Dr. Factor said it's obviously not a a mouse because if it's a mouse, okay, you can't it's nicer. It's a bri asthma. But you have something like this. Let's say where was that? I saw it somewhere here. You have this. Oops. Take a McDonald's and you grind it into the into the pot. Okay. It mixes in with the chunk. You take the mouse and you grind it into the chunk. Yeah. No, David. I missed you. How much of this chunk do you have to eat? Think about it. To get malus, you have little pieces of mouse. A lot of little pieces of mouse. How much chunk do you have to eat? The whole chunk is mousy. All the potatoes. How much to get malus? You need you need a you need a kazay. You need a kazay. So how much how much chunk do you have to eat? How much? >> Huh? >> Good. Cuz you know this stuff. Next. >> Anybody? Nobody's going to answer that without without knowing the s inside house. >> How much? >> Kaz of mouse. >> Kaz of mouse. You're right. You need to eat a kaz of mouse. It's not enough to eat a kaz of ch. The whole ch is mousy. But eating one potato kazai potato is not going to make you get malus. What do you have to you have to in order to be you have to eat a kaz of mouse. That's how it goes. A kaz of mouse time out. I'll tell you in a second to get malus of the mouse and it has to be within a certain amount of time within 2 minutes which is called this is what we once did or I did once a long time ago back in the day before we had Yoshi means a half a half of what a half of a loaf of bread which equals four eggs cuz the bread is eight eggs as long as it takes you to eat four eggs remember by people are are rushing to eat that kazay Because you can't just take a half hour. You have to eat it within a certain amount of time. Whatever's to be to the mitzvah of this Yoshi did this to show it's a half a bread. You see he did a bowl of soup a half a loaf of bread and to eat the entire inside of that half a loaf of bread and how long? If you eat it within this amount, whatever that amount is, boom, it's red. that's this or you this or if you eat it anything longer than that if you're taking your time like this guy then you're not this and you don't get the malus so says the very simple if the flavor and the physical being of it those pieces of mouse if it's like a mouse like in olive you get malas if you eat it but this You have to eat a kaz mouse within the two minutes or whatever it is. Listen, I'm just calling it 2 minutes cuz I think that that's something that stuck in my head back then. It's about 2 minutes. >> What? Why not? >> Now, here here's the next thing. Look, look, look, look, look. Huh? Oh. 2 minutes to 9 minutes. Okay. >> Two to 9. I'll show you. >> What if you put in So Rashi says something super interesting. We did a a thing for it, but it's like Tyus is all over Rashi, but Rashi says it here because this is a very in only show have something like this. It looks like it's closed the bottle milk, but it could still pour out of it. It's not a problem. If you pour milk into the chunk, it's gone. Where is it? It's It's nothing. Or the other. Oh, you saw that. He's very serious and now he's the says makes no sense. You can never be fine. It's in there. So, let let's even say you take fat that just becomes it disintegrates. melts. Melts right into the ch. It's not piecy. So what's there? You don't have pieces. You see mushroom means pieces. >> Yeah. But doesn't mean you have to eat all the pieces. Means the pieces exist and they're there. >> So what are you eating? >> You're eating a potato which is >> I don't know. I don't know. I hear what you're saying. I hear you gave this d so you know better. >> I think it's evenly dispersed. Is that what you're saying? If you don't get malusa and if you have much of this mouse it tastes mousy motor. Now what's the the question over here just the technical question enough of we we had enough of trauma just from this this is very traumatic for a lot of people now it's test what's this reeba why do you have to introduce a new language here when we're struggling as is >> he's listening to this really boring thing you keep keep on goinga Thank you. He wants to know what the real is. >> What's your name? Sadik. >> Rose. >> Are you a Ribuli fan? >> Huh? >> You listen to on a on a >> I just needed the I didn't have one. >> I wasn't listening to him. >> But we also have Okay, whatever. Give him a bice, please. >> All you have to do is ask. That's how it starts. >> It's your fault. It's your fault. >> That's how it starts. >> Yeah. Yeah. You know what the Gimar says? Like first you you you you sit, then you this. First you go for the gamarra, then by mistake you listen, and eventually you're going to get over there. Know your volume could be a problem. I love your ribs. Really? Somebody's going to cut it out and show you. Okay. >> Yeah. It's unbelievable. Okay. Absolutely. Just to explain, I'm middle of sheer here. We're talking about noise and time of gum and all of a sudden I hear your voice from the back the most corner seat and allowed loud and for a few seconds like it didn't go off right away. Okay. The guy, we have a guest. We made a little bit. He needed a garra. I'm I'm not I'm not trying to be needed a gamarra and he went to your uh app. He has a good app and he had the gumar and by mistake it pushed. Well, just it made for time here. Oh, hold on. Says why do you have to say that's not how you we call we call not test not even though to get to this terrible flavor there are other things causing that bad flavor. Nevertheless, we call it a bad flavor that comes from this from this mouse. It's mousy and it's says we go with the second of what that if you have a mouse and you have bad flavor in the in the food. Anyways, we're going to go with the mouse and the mouse gives bad flavor. So, what is it called?

No, not he's not ready yet. >> What do you got? >> Uh, give me >> give you another minute. >> We'll be done with the daff in a minute. whatever you'll you'll raise your hand if you have something. So I try to point it out as as we're going along just to do a stickle review. So far we didn't have a single shita that says that of is is that if it imparts a bad flavor nobody says it's everybody says we started off the whole says is he says then the next one we had a whole thing with the with the vinegar in the greasin and at the end of the day it since it imparts a bad flavorish and we even passing like the the of gum since it's it's bad even if there not only if it's bad but even if there's other bad flavors in the says the whole it's mut the mouse is so he says says we're learning it right now reeba he added too much bad flavor it's the says why call it why just say why reeba so he said oh even if there's other flavors there the mouse is completely mut so says from all this I see nice and I agree to all of it just to remind the look at this he's talking about he's not saying I say this he says they the said I'll explain what they meant they didn't mean that it's too much salt too little salt but he's not going his own cheetah. He's not he's not saying what I what he himself holds. Okay. So fine. Good. So it's all these minus because he wasn't talking it's not his own. He's just saying okay end the story. But the says you tell me look how many people say it's but who says it's I never saw a single she since the even the mish talks about pouring vinegar on the greas that it makes it mut who says the opposite of that says there is a name is yes there is somebody that says and in fact it says in the whether It's for the bad or for the good even bad flavors and the isar is going to explain where he got it from. And that's what we're holding. If it adds good flavor the mouse mousy is good then it would be but if it's bad it's time where did get this from. So in the P it says this is talking about went to they grab all their stuff. Imagine you have pots that the cooked pork in there says the what do you do? You just put it into the fire. You do either with a fire and if it can't go in a fire you put it in in the in the water. That's what we do today. So there's all you wanted to M Shabas didn't have time he wanted to next time let's say you take a donkey and you cook it in a pot right and it's dead so part of the donkey goes little parts of the donkey donkey miniature donkeys go into the walls of the pact that's called ble it's a ble it gets absorbed by the the wall of the pot. Now, if it's fresh, so it tastes good. It's donkey meat, but let's say it's 3 4 days old. There's nothing worse than that. 4 day old spoiled donkey meat inside the pot. So, what's the problem? If went to Midian and they took a pot full of pork in the walls of the It's disgusting. You You don't have to do according to what you're telling me. That's called and is you don't have to go you don't have to you don't have to do anything. So why why does the say they have to do? Obviously the holds that even though it's disgusting you still have to do. What could be an obvious answer that we're not talking about that it's a few days old. It's talking about that day they just cooked it that morning and the took it. So it says Isn't Isn't it a terrible taste of terrible taste says you can't use the cle until you do ask so there's no different what's the [Music] like he says here this guy did a all sorts the people now sending stuff in. Here's a a non-Jew in the morning. And if you look, there's a clock over there. It's not so clear. And then immediately afterwards, you have the Jew cooking. If it's if it's the same day, by the way, so talking about it, a lot of the Israelis knew that. I don't know if I myself wasn't so cle about it, but everybody in the Shir knew this. If you go to the hagum over here, I was very spoiled when I was here. I was only here for one pes during co I think it was. They they set up here in the parking lot. By the way, if you come here in the morning, you're a guest. We love guests and everything. And if this is a very hard parking situation, you can park. There's a giant parking lot on the bottom of the street. You just have to walk literally 2 minutes. So, in that parking lot, they set up for free massive uh pots, vats, and with big burners, and everybody comes with their cumul. So, one of the things that they tell you there is do not bring kale that are don't bring kale that are one day old. This is what we're learning right now because in what happens is what? >> Used within a day. >> Used within a day. Why? Because it has the ble. It has these things in it. And what happens to to the stuff absorbed? It goes into the water. And then you get another one and another one. You have all these bad bleas inside the water. Now the water becomes this. So everybody scream out here and cheer. And it's true. They put a they put bleach into the water. Why? Because now any bleach that comes out of the pad becomes disgusting anyways. It's not edible. So, I don't care how many ble. But they still tell you don't bring it. Some places tell you don't even bring old pots. We don't want old pots. We only want to do new pots. Cuz new pots is another problem that I saw a whole article about it. I don't want to make you guys mishuga. You know the but basically the outside the thing that makes the pot shiny is made out of animal something. So the how much is a bottle and it's a mash mash was a whole what do you do with the stuff? And even if you do hagal kale it doesn't come off. The pot remains shiny. Why? Because it's a certain thing that gets absorbed. Anyway, fine. So, time time out. Let's just explain that before I skip. You went to war and you grabbed it that day. What do you mean? Pork that's 6 hours old, 9 hours old, disgusting out of the fridge. It's disgusting. It's a little bit disgusting. Nevertheless, you have to do and the says if not the says it's awesome. Why does that where did he get this idea that a terrible flavor makes something? I you and I wouldn't know this by ourselves that a dead mouse in your ch because it gives a bad flavor. The ch is ker where I where did I get it from? He says because it says in the don't eat any you give it to the but you have to be able to give it to has to be something that's edible for something that's the something that you can eat is an something that's not for is not called a now time out for mayor he says okay that's that's a good Russian I also but a little bit different may The puzz is coming to say that if an animal's born disgusting, let's say it has boils and sat whatever it is so disgusting then that's something you don't give to the you don't you don't give to ma for you it's also kosher it doesn't trafe up your your food I don't need a puzz for that an animal that's born with boils and has tass you don't need a for one minute we have a story >> no >> how long is the story >> I'll do a 90 seconds >> a 90 second story okay let's go let's hear from the world famous story time a boy in fifth grade and he can't understand anything that's going on in this year's like Chinese and he's getting like 30s and 40s on all his tents and his the one thing that he liked was basketball and he liked Michael Jordan so his father said you know what you get a 90 six months in a row I'll take you to a Michael Jordan game in Madison Square Gardens so he said okay he never got a 90 before never got higher than a 30 he tried as a focus in class but it was just going right through his head. But after school, he would call like the best kids in the class and ask them, "What did Rebby do?" He got a quick summary and he was able to do it. And like that, he was able to get 90s on every test in a row. He called kids after school. For five months in a row, he's doing it. And finally, after 6 months, his father said, "Okay, we'll go to a game." Worked very hard. Goes into the game, gives in his ticket, runs in, and the guy says, "Hey, get back here." Says, "What's the matter?" The guy says, "Get back here. Your tickets are fake." Says, "What are you talking about?" They bought two tickets right outside. They scalped tickets and the tickets were fake and he got kicked out of the stadium. His father felt terrible. He said, "You know what? We'll go to a restaurant. We watch on a big screen." He said, "No, I want to be with Michael Jordan." He had pictures of Michael Jordan all around his bed, t-shirts of Michael Jordan. He wanted to see Michael Jordan. So his father, he said, "I just want to go back home." He takes him back home and he goes back to school back to 30s and 40s throughout high school. And that's how he finished school. And I know this story is true because that was me. I wanted to see Michael Jordan. But then I came to her troll afterwards and I saw what true greatness is doing like 31 block on Chabas in 4 hours. That I believe is uh is true greatness. So [Music] >> wonderful >> merit the of spreading Torah throughout the world. Sponsor a shir today. mdysponsor.com or sponsor at mdy.com.
