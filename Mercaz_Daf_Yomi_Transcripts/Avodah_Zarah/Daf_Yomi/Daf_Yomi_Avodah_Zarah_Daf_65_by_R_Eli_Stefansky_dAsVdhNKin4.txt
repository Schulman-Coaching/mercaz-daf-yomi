My children already know that it's the first order of business each day. It's a habit that I'm truly proud of. Needless to say the daff has changed and enhanced my life by teaching me many I never learned in yeshiva. This is giving more meaning to my avoid in many ways.

You should have holding on the last last words of with B. So don't get used to it. That was in Benim was shorter. So we're holding where we need to be holding. I I have to tell you, listen, it was it was tough. It was fun, but it was hard. And you got to daff on. You got to prepare da give to shirim and you guys have to learn the daff. And um preparation was not the same. And I'm happy to be back Sunday with I hope I recharge my batteries. Right now I need to recharge my batteries for recharging my batteries. That's normal. No >> 100%. >> So the batteries are recharged. We have stories over here because this is a des typical with stories with gishmakudo sends a gift to a on his holiday that that's the first Mishna of of should not send a gift to three days before his holiday. He sends it on the holiday. >> I know him. He's not a good We had this. The The Israelis did a cool thing. So, because some of you I know for a fact you weren't here. Um you didn't see this. I'm going to show it to you cuz it's we we just hired two new people this week and the guy does very good work. I want to show you this thing. So the Israelis said this is from so >> I'll let you watch it then I'll tell you what the Israelis did with this. >> He's selling all his stuff. He's becoming a Gary this guy. >> This is okay. This is interesting. He's trying to do this. >> But this is Gishmak. Look at this. He's walking up FDI steps. So, so the Israelis said that they they found they found out it's a terrible story. They found out this guy was an impostor. He's not a real giving shim. Come come tonight to see the real Machir. Whatever. They sent this out. Anyway, fire. Why did I say that? I have no idea. Anyway, so there's a go. There's not a go. He knew for a fact that there's a famous joke in but I I'll I'll say that you know to insult a different group instead of this group. There's a an Arab an Arab worker tells tells the guy he's working he says he needs a break. He says why do you need a break? He says I need to eat lunch. He says but it's Ramadan. You don't eat lunch. He says no no no I'm not what you called. I'm light. So there's a guy that works does have a desire and there's a guy that doesn't do a desire. What do you mean? You can't just know him. You know your neighbor doesn't do you have to know. He has to accept upon himself not to work not to worship. can't just say oh I don't do I know that he doesn't do we we discussed this yesterday a whole about what's either either he doesn't do or he accept upon himself or he does all the but he eats but he does say we're learning that the whole what's what's a what's the difference he accepted seven mitzvah he didn't accept what's the difference to us the difference to us is do you have to keep him alive to give to to sustain there's and I spoke to people after Shir also yesterday because I said the story inv there's a group of guys and a guy came over to me after she says I was part of a different group in a different yeshiva that when you need emergency there's not a lot of people don't donate that much blood here in the the uh reserves are low so if there's an emergency they call up these guys these we call them up in middle of night hey 3 in the morning run over to the hospital right now we need blood we need platelets whatever it So one night the guy wakes up. He says, "Listen, but I got to tell you the truth." This is Shalanu this guy. So it's 3:00 in the morning. We're going to wake up all So they ask you got to you might have to go start if you could get out of it and you don't you know that I'm not going because he's not a not a Okay. So, but is there you have you do have to get up at 3 in the morning to to keep him alive. But that's when the guy decides to get but now I see somebody's very upset about this. What? What happened? >> What are you saying? >> She go there for sure because he's a G. >> He's not a G. No, I said not a G. I'm talking. >> Yeah. Why? >> There's different reasons. Okay, fine. That's why you have to ask the but another problem. The guy didn't have a he had 12 months to to to get it done. He didn't do it. So this obviously didn't have so he's still a guy he's still he's still he's a he's a min how can you give him a a gift on his and by the way you have to point out here that they ask I think the even if he's not of so what are you giving him a gift on his on his holiday and the answer is if you're if you're American You know, there's a lot of guy that keep, let's say, Christmas, but they're not they're not fully involved. They don't they don't bring kerbanas. They give the gifts. They take the day off. Of course, a free day off. Why not? It's a fun day. They celebrate it, but very very So, so this guy was celebrating it in also. There's the certain days that people make barbecues even though they're not part of, you know, it's a barbecue day. Over here, he gave him an animal to make a barbecue. Why not? What are you smiling about? >> Good reference. Okay. >> Well done. >> Okay. Well played. >> There's no he gave him an animal for for the bar for to make a manga. Doesn't mean that he's going to bring a carbon. Not everybody brings carbonas. Some people are not so involved in the holiday and they just make a mangalite. >> Light. Exactly. >> It's a new beer. No, no, no, no. That light. >> Ah. He doesn't say hal, but he makes a manga. It's a It's a new It's a new gather. So says, you know, who's a min a guy who's in bad shape is a guy who accepted about himself and at the end he didn't do it. So we call him a min. But this guy just doesn't do. He's smart enough to realize that the that this piece of wood is not not his god and he doesn't do but he he never accepted upon himself to be mal. So we're not going to hold it against him. So rava so Rabuda gave him a carbon. Same exact story with Rava. But this is a super interesting story. It's actually a famous story because of all the detail here and it's a story that we really have to understand. I'm not I don't understand it myself. There's a lot of things that are hard to understand. Roa brings a carbon to this person by the name of his holiday. Same thing. I know he's not going to bring this type of so I have no problem giving him an animal. He goes, he's sitting in rose water in pedals in this unbelievable bath and is undressed in front of him. The guy tells, "Are you going to enjoy yourself like this in the world to come? What do you mean we're going to enjoy? We're going to enjoy much more than this little bit of a depiction here. I just I like this rose barrel right over here and has a brings him a car. So, how's it possible? How you what do you mean more than this? Anan like to heaven. What bothered me is imagine any rasha rod walking into that situation. What would they do? >> They would run for their life. He's having a conversation with him. Does like it's hard to understand. Guy's in the bath. I don't know what's going on all over here. This all sorts of mari suro more than user. And he's he's having a schmuzz with him. The only thing I could I could the only thing I could think of is imagine you are the head of a good and you're representing Trump and you walk in and Trump is sitting there and there's I don't know what all over you got to continue. I mean you're you're cla you're not you're not just by himself you if you walk out then you walked out on cla now he's going to take it out on cla roll. I don't know what. So he closes his eyes he does what he does what he has to do >> but he keeps on he has a conversation. He's being serious with this individual. I don't know. It's like I didn't see anybody talk about it, but Huh. >> talks about when there was someone who was waiting till the woman went out of their place. They look like >> No, that's that's different. That's different over here. He walks into the situation. I'm just saying if it happened to anybody else and he stayed in that situation, his career is over. You know, nowadays we're much we're much more than this. >> Fine. >> It's a video that we know better. It's not a picture. >> Huh? >> It's a video. >> What's a video? What you >> Oh, it's a video. >> I I don't know if I want to see it. >> Okay, let's see. >> He's sitting there with his flippers. >> No, the green flippers. >> Oh, hold on. >> Oh, this is this is the end of the story. We didn't even get to this part yet. >> Oh. Oh. >> Oh, that's the end. >> Okay. >> Yeah. We got to see the gimmar first. >> So when I was learning this gimmar and you can see this over here, I noticed that I have no writings in my gimar over here. Like wow, I must have not given shear here. And then all of a sudden, no texts me and he's like, I noticed in my gumar I have a lot of harus in the mifa. And that's that's where he gave shear. Yeah, >> that's it. Your patch is off. We'll talk about it later. >> So, I guess No, then sent me something about it, but I I didn't I didn't have a chance to look at it. Something that, you know, Where is he? Is he here? No, he's here last night. So, so he probably explained where he took over. You took over. I have no idea. Anyway, so we're in the middle of this and he says, "Why? Why are we better? Sorry. You have the fear of the king in the future in MS. We have no fear. We sit there and enjoy ourselves without any fear. I saw somebody wrote that to give a man a guy is in reserve cut says I have the best, you know, one of the best restaurants in in Manhattan. Sitting there $300 a person. The big fat steak comes out and all of a sudden the IRS representative shows up at your table, stands there, we got a smooz. >> How much of an appetite do you have? You know, your whole this Yeah, you enjoy yourself. Now, what happens if the king uh summons you? >> And of course, I know like what what fear of the king do I have? They're just sitting around. All of a sudden, a messenger of the king comes. Get up. The king wants you. When he got up, he says, says, "The eye that wants to see bad to you Jews should fly out of his socket." He's trying to be nice, but he just he said ano. He didn't even know what he was saying. Thank you. Great that second. His eye pops out of the socket. So now we have to see this again. Now that we know the whole story, he's sitting there enjoying himself. He has his goggles on. >> I don't know. There's no volume. I heard the bing. Fine. How come didn't answer from this that who's going to who's going to serve them? the daughters of the kings of the world. When everybody knows the truth, they're going to give you cover even the the the queen is going to stand straight to your to your right, you know, wear all these golden >> uh ornaments and jewelry. In other words, you have the lowest low of the people of the world and we're going to have the highest. We're going to have the queens not not for but to to serve us. Why don't you say this other an eye is never seen a human being. There's no being that understands and saw besides you. Only you know what awaits those who are able to to wait to the time. It's going to be unbelievable. It's a pel this whole what the whole we're here in this world to to work on our to to break our and he's telling him look all you don't have better than you don't have and what does he kind of plays plays with him he doesn't say no this is the bad we no we have we have more the king it's we have to understand this there's different different things different different say different things Everybody can say their own shot here. But if you're transporting other stuff and he throws in a bottle of so you're allowed to take the payment. Now I want to preface this that when it says you're allowed to take the payment it doesn't mean the payment of the of a that we'll say this hopefully I say it again. If not, you'll remind me. You're not permitted to take a payment for a desire to take payment of not for so if you're getting paid the whole day 100 shekel and you did a little aid. So you have to take off five shekel, throw it away, throw it into the garbage, give it back to the guy, the is on the 95, they allow to take the 95. That doesn't affect the whole the whole payment. and it's not just a it's actually in the according to means after hours when he already finished work at 5:00 everybody goes home at 5:05 he he he slept this barrel of a desine and that doesn't affect the rest of the the payment the salary our mission doesn't talk about after hours. Our mission says you take the salary no matter what. When it doesn't matter when he slept it, it doesn't say in the mission when he slept it. Even if he he carried this barrel for the guy this 9:00 in the morning, it's fine. after hours by night time. Please take this barrel of from one place to another place. Once again, you're allowed to get your salary. It's not referring to the the the salary for the barrel of wine. It's referring to the entire amount of money that he made besides the amount. But it says before it's only because it's after hours but the rest of the day you're not permitted. Therefore says you're right. We have to say huh >> then part of the salary is also for the moving of the barrel. That's why meaning if it's then it's separate. It's a separate salary. >> It's not over time. It's separate. I already committed to you for your work during the day. Now at night I'm asking you to do this. >> Yeah. It's it's separate. Exactly. If it's not, we're going to see in a second. In two seconds, we're going to see. Don't argue with him. He gave the gave a shar. He gave a share on this town. Yeah. >> We're going to see. We're going to see soon >> for you though. >> You're going to see soon that when the salary is dependent on David, so ruin's all salary. When it's not dependent on, so it's fine. So over here, it's not dependent. The salary is not dependent on because it's after hours. So you allow to take it which is a big it doesn't there's no mention of it in our we must explain you're right because of this we're talking about it's night time it's after hours it's not dependent says let me explain to you wants to say like he agrees with in in concept but he says maybe we could explain during regular hours. I could also separate your the salary into different pieces during the day. How do I do that? He says, I want you to bring over 100 barrels and I'm going to pay you at the end of the day 100, which which would seem like that if you don't bring all 100 barrels, you don't get paid. You have to bring a 100 to get 100. So, If he brings 99, no good. If he brings a 100 and that 100th one is then it's good. That means all 99 other barrels are dependent on the 100. Otherwise, he doesn't get paid at all. It has an effect on the entire salary. You can't take your salary. But if he says, "Listen, bring as many as you want. You want to work, you want to bring one at a time, bring one at a time. You want to bring 99, bring 99. You want to bring 100, bring 100." So for the 99 he gets paid for 99. He gets paid his salary. For the hundred he tells the guy, "Listen, keep the hundred or if he if he pays him a $100 bill, he takes one cent and throws it into the ocean. I'll prove it to you. Bring a 100 barrels for 100." Why? Because everything is dependent on each other. Each barrel is dependent on the other and one of them was a barrel. So all hundred are like the and it's to take any of the salary. He says specifically so got this idea from I'm just going to repeat this. It's awesome to bring it. You're not benefit. But if you went ahead and you did for whatever reason you forgot you didn't know you don't care then don't take salary for it. If you another case, same idea as the fata, but this time you are hiring a taxi driver, a donkey driver to bring you're not allowed to take the but if you're if you'reing other stuff and there you bring a barrel of wine, it's okay. Ask the same exact case save because this brings us to another idea I need for the second case. the the guy hired the Jew to take him somewhere on the donkey. You're permitted the Jew driver could take the the payment even though he slept a whole canteen full of wine was why could he take why could he take the payment but he just he just helped the guy bring Do you know who perhaps you could say because when you pay a guy in a taxi you don't pay him for the canteen you pay take me from here to there happens to be I slept a canteen with me now in our days obviously that's how it goes but in time of the garra was very different everything that you bring on the donkey was very calculated how how much could I bring how many pairs of socks how many drinks how many snacks and then the driver also brings stuff and each one has a certain reading this and I I learned this on the plane. I was thinking to myself, it's unbelievable. When I was writing in my Gimmorra, it was smooth like literally sitting here on the desk. It was unbelievable. Nothing. No shaking garnished in the taxi. It was impossible to write the whole time. Cars, I don't know if we realized our brains are like this. Don't dane is unbelievable smooth. But imagine riding on a donkey. Riding and writing kadushim on a donkey. It's not and to go from to is a 4 day, you know, takes in a car. 30 minutes is 4 days to get there. You have to stop and dangerous thing. It's unbelievable what they had to go through. And you you're shleing a donkey. You have to bring food. You have to bring and you need food for the donkey. He there's no gas station. So, you have to fill them up in the middle. You have to take off the whole here. What to do? And that's what we're going to get into. So the question is, do you have the right to bring wine? Let's say the has right to bring a canteen with him. That's part of what he's paying. So that's what that's part of what he's paying. Then the Jew made made money on it. Did you charge him $1,000 to go from Bamesh to? It's a 4-day trip. It's $1,000. What are you laughing about? What's going on here? >> Yeah. No, you can't. >> We can't say it. It's a good one, but he can't say it. >> He knows it. >> Can't say. Okay, good. >> There's a there's a joke going around here that I don't know what it is. It's not Roy for this year. Trust me, it's not Roy, but these guys are laughing. They're saying it bunch of I have here. >> How hard this must be for you? >> No, not at all. It's hard for them. Not for me. I have no So, Oh, so you hired this donkey driver. Oh, here we go. Here's the donkey driver. >> You see the leg by his left b leg over there? That's the little So, the question is, does did he pay for that? If he paid for it, if a $100 of the thousand dollars goes for his canteen, then the Jew is making money off Yanessa. If it's $1,000 and he just happened to bring a canteen with him, then he's not getting paid for it. But here, look, it says Mafur. When you hire a donkey, so here's a good here's another picture. Here's that's what happened. Guy told him he's bringing too much. Okay. This his clothing. He's allowed to bring some food, snacks. >> Yeah. McDonald's. Because he's a guy. He's allowed to bring his wine. So, in other words, he's paying for his wine and all the food for that for that trip. And more than that, the driver could stop and bring more. How much could he bring? He needs he needs food for the donkey and and sustenance for that day. Only for that day, not for the whole trip. More than that, the renter could say, "No, I'm not I'm not allowing to bring more food." So, he's paying for his flask of wine. He's permitted to bring his thing. It's a kiss from Hashem. It happens to be. I was on a flight yesterday and and and and it's unbelievable. I was on a flight and on in a taxi so I have good when you're on a flight when you buy a flight everybody knows you get one suitcase for free. Now if you're 1k you get 370 pounders. I hate you by the way that's a different story. I just became gold. Like I don't even know how like I don't care about I never cared about miles and this kind that galdic but the worst is I was able to bring two suitcases of 70 and sitting sitting there with the scale making sure it's 50 49.5 cuz if it's 51 they they and I could they she tells me no you could have had 70 oh two 70s. >> Wow. Could have brought more scope more shampoo deodorant. Wow. >> Hines no hines ketchup. That's all. Yeah. Fine. I'll go bon. Yeah. Yeah, you everybody knows this mush. It's now we can relate to this. You go on a flight, you paid for your ticket, you paid for your suitcase, you come there and say, "Listen, Rebbitson, I didn't bring a suitcase. I want $100 back." Doesn't work like that. You paid for a flight. The flight includes a suitcase. You want you don't want to bring a suitcase, don't bring a suitcase. You want to bring a suit, bring a suitcase. You're not going to get your money back. Your trip includes a flask of wine. You don't want to bring it, don't bring it. You're not getting any money back. So, the Jew is not gaining by you bringing the flask. It just includes certain things. Now why now we're just going to go into this into this idea of of how much he could bring in. He can bring I saw some shilas here. There's a m with yeshiva where just it's you know what I'll start from Shimmy Weiss. I got to start from Shimmy. Shimmy was a big part of our he died very young and he told us he got to Florida. He asked when's when's that on? So they said 5:30. Said, "Okay." 5:30 comes. He goes to the guy's house. He knocks. Nobody opens. So he goes in, he walks in, sits down. All of a sudden, he sees a barrel of a gun pointing down the stairs like, "Whoa, whoa, what's going He says, the guy says, and he's in his pajamas." He's like, "Dude, what are you doing in my house?" He says, "The you said the shears at 5:30." 5:30 in the afternoon, you idiot. >> Okay. And he shows up in the guy's house. It's 5:30. Wakes him up. The guy hears noise in his dining room. Show you know it's Florida. Everybody has a gun. What? >> How was the guy's door open? Florida. >> Florida. >> I want to tell you, you ask me. >> My Yeah. Listen to this. Listen to this. >> My son-in-law tells me you have to see this guy's house. I'm a good friend. He became friendly with a guy there >> in Park City. So, okay, let's go. He's not there. He's already That's his vacation home. So, we pull up and the the gate opens up like this. You just pull up to the gate. We come in there. There's a a barn. The barn must have cost over a million dollars. It's a three-story barn, massive. He has three pieces of of uh exercise equipment, a few pairs of skis, and two bikes for a million. He built himself a million-doll barn to house that. Then this massive house on a lake, his own private lake, two horses, bunch of chickens, whole crazy. I have I have video if anybody wants to see you. You just walk into the house. Everything's unlocked. So anybody can just pull up, gates open up the whole house. >> Post it on the screen. >> Yeah, exactly. >> Yeah, >> it's Park City. There's no there's no crime there. There's nothing. Garners, he left. He left for a few months. Left his house and maybe he has a he probably has a few people working there. I say he's taking care of the horses and everything. Lock cameras. He's got cameras. He's over there. I'm there taking his whole house out. Cameras. >> Big long driveway. M sugar. Okay, fine. Next for remind me. No door. A door unlock. So what's the case? Everybody, both people need to eat. So how come he gets to bring a whole week's worth of food and the driver not if he could buy if there's 7-Eleven everywhere? So why could he bring seven days worth? Just go into the store and and buy some food. There's no stores anywhere. So, how could the the the passenger prevent the driver from bringing more food? If you really want to work hard and knock on people's doors from day to day, you can find food. It's normal for a driver to go and shle and figure out where the food is. Therefore, it's not the the way for the passenger to look for food. He doesn't know how to do it. So, he gets to bring more food. Before you turn the page, there's something very interesting. Before you turn the page, read this slowly. Ra, the father of RA, [Music] the father of Raa, the son of Raika. In other words, Ra was the son of Ravika. So, we're talking about Ravik, but we're calling him Raika. It's a very very weird way to call a person raik. Okay. His job was to pour wine from the barrels into the small flasks for and he would take it across the river. And we see this over and over and even they didn't necessarily pay with cash. They pay with different things. So he got paid with barrels. They they snitched on him. They said Ravik is dealing with the concern is that in the bottom of every guy's flask, there's a little tiny bit of in there. He makes his flask. Then he drinks it and there's always a little bit on the bottom. So when I pour my kosher wine into his flask, it turns into he's working with kosher wine. Then it hits the bottom over there. It's not a problem. Again, something that we saw over and over. When you Jew want the existence of the you're happy when it exists. That's also when you want, we said the guy got paid to break all the barrels of of wine. That's problematic. Why? Because you want the barrels to exist. The more barrels of the more you get paid. Cuba we said tifla is better to break the b. But over here he wants the wine to exist. Why the zik what if the you know they didn't have the plastic that we have today that it never explodes. One in a billion explodes over there. It was made out of uh of leather and every once in a while it would explode. Now what would happen if it explode? He would have to give up his barrel that he worked so hard for. So the Jew doesn't want the guy's um canteen flask to break and he's right to be he wants it to exist because he's thinking about himself. He's being selfish. No, he's not thinking about himself. Makes a deal with them that even if your flask breaks, you don't get my barrel. So he's safe. He doesn't he does he does not want everybody brings a spare flask in case it breaks. They don't they don't take the barrel. says, "Good morning, but we have another problem." What >> flask? You want the flask. You don't care for the little bit of yf inside. You don't want You're not rich with the little y. >> What was it have to do with the flask? >> What have to do with the flask? >> Oh, sponsor. >> That's a good way to get out of his do. He's bringing the wine across the river. How can he do that? He's working with the flat. So how could he slept afterwards? Says my he tells the guy that that that that takes him over the the water. He tells him he tells him beforehand, I'm going to have some clients. You just do me a favor. Take them over for free. He he ties some He doesn't even deal with it. He doesn't say anything. Anybody that comes with a certain knot and a string gets to go across the river by himself. Here we have here. Where was this? Right over here. One second. Sponsor [Music] even. [Applause] [Music] So that's the rope. The little rope. Okay. Galdic. Oo I want I really want to show you this maybe before the mission sponsors remind me to show you this thing turning of the death global is enjoying the benefit of meers of MDY clients create more than so can help us all get anonymous who's still sitting shiva today I believe no >> last day >> today's last day he told me he keeps on sending me he says you don't understand how many people came from people flew they took flights people drove people um the amount of messages and he's a sadic I heard from different people he wrote back to people private like not not the the text that everybody sends out each person got a anonymous and I'll just show you this do we have we don't have time it's ready 802 I'll have to show it a different time okay remind me this somebody sent me a very nice uh video of I'll just show this real quickly John Stern I'm not going to show the whole thing remind me to So this is today today's day and age the process very interesting it's massive this thing a whole it's 2 minutes I can't show the whole thing I'll show 20 seconds I'll show the rest a different time you'll see the stems go in here you see all the stems everything this machine separates the stems from the grapes then the machine it's a whole beautiful process right now what >> right now is a season >> we should really go >> find let's find out where it is let's go it's to get a get a little tourn says you have a big problem. You have this terrible wine that's falls on top of grapes. What do you do? You just wash it off in water because it didn't penetrate the grape. It's not adding anything to the grape and then you're allowed to eat the grapes. But if the grapes have cracks in them, so there's a very interesting tis here. I thought it's important to know says as soon as you pop that grape off the stem, it creates a little hole in it. So if falls on it, goes into it. So must be talking about this is all these grapes are attached to the stems. If the same falls on different type of fruit called figs or dates, most people here don't even know what a fig tastes like cuz it's very problematic, I think, to eat figs. or maybe they don't. But the tomorrow I I'm not saying this to to be nice to my my good friend from California, but he sent me two bags of dates. He sent me in the past dates, but this time he sent me dates. I'm telling you, I've never had dates like this in my life. It was like I have it here at home. If anybody's mug date person, I'll tell me and I'll It tastes like candy, but not stam candy. Bamis, like just pure candy. Like, you know, you buy this caramel candy and the whole thing is like gooey. That's what it That's what it tastes like. Unbelievable. It's not it's not a fruit. So if it adds we know this whole kind of if it adds good flavor to the dates to the figs also makes everything also. If it adds flavor to the dates what's the and I'll bring you here. Here here's the story. And there's a story but this guy this person and we had him a few times growing and he brought these figs on a on a boat story that we're talking about the wine fell on it and what should be the so that's the famous line in the gorister you tell me a story right after he told me he told me a story that's exact opposite Zach says the also if it gives a good flavor it's if it doesn't add any flavor that's going to be the answer of the GRA that the story is to say that if that was a case that it didn't give a good flavor and therefore it is motor just missing a couple of words >> are grapes different >> because just the way they're the the composition of the grape it has it has like a thick skin >> even if it doesn't give time it says it's >> no it's >> right that cuz G does give tam if it's also it has it has a certain skin on it that it repels no if you know if you if you wash it in the sink all the flavor goes away but in a a fig and a date is is thinner skin so the the wine penetrates it's just the the way it's composed the the the the mitsas of of a date is different will penetrate no matter what >> like vinegar and if you put vinegar into your child you know it's going to happen it's a bad thing so So it's a bad thing. So it's ask my solicitor telling me a story that's against the that we just said a second ago. It's missing a few words, but it's self understood. If it's giving if it gives a bad flavor, it's maybe because over there it's a different type of fig. It's on a ship. It's a older one. It's a dried out fig. The wine is no good for it. They they said listen it's bad for those type if it so it's all dependent if it's a fig that's good for it it adds flavor it's also by it added flavor and was bad for it no good says same story wine fell on a bunch of wheat now I just want to pause here for a millisecond just because we said this a bunch of times in the what does Of who? Oh. Oh, yeah. You're right. I do have here. >> Oh, yeah. Thank you. We were here yesterday. This is the fig thing. This m the story of the Titanic. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Yeah, like no, you missed the whole punch line is that he after he saved he had nothing to eat cuz he had the on his figs. Okay, >> so sh Oh, so here's a sh Why can't you take a bunch of wheat and put it in the sink and rinse it off? What's the answer? Wheat. Wheat. You have wheat is the same story that we had in the mish but with wheat. >> It's absorbed. >> Why? >> It went inside for some reason. Goes inside. But oh, so I was in the middle of my thing before I was uh so rudely interrupted to show the video. But you're right cuz it was in the sug before it says. So I just want to point out. No. What's you said the you have to tell me means wine that's also but sometimes it doesn't mean that. It's like we call it today us what do we say? Oh the guy that touched >> we have to be talking about that type of because if it's that somebody took it and poured it to would not say you're sell you're not touch you have to spill into the toilet. So let's read it again. There was a bunch of and a bunch of fell not real the fake stuff that we call today which we call what was it called? He said, "You know what?" So he asked the question to be a guy is putting together in those days, you know, thread by thread. One of the 10,000 threads happens to be and you're making a pish clothing. So now you have a problem of climb. You're not permitted to sell to go. Why not? Why can't you sell climb to go? A guy could wear climb. So why can't you sell it? He'll sell it back to a Jew. Are you allowed to make a a saddle for donkey out of out of? Yes, 100%. Why? It's a tougher material. It's not a problem. The whole problem is that it might go into your clothing. That's the problem in terms of you sitting on it. There's no but don't make it a saddle. You could a mace has zero mitzvah. That's it. Right? We have to knock it into our head. A dead person cannot accomplish anymore. Can't you can't learn to can't do mitzvah. >> Mitzvah says, >> "Yeah, let let his family." Okay. >> I don't know. Cuz you don't have a maze, but you want to do it for mitzvah. I don't know. Good. >> They take it out also. >> Okay. Take it out. >> So, with the stiper, they didn't want to sit. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I had the same Shiloh. Sil didn't want to sit on a thing, but Yeah. Because maybe it was a little softer. I was thinking it's a little little cushiony, but a thicker one. Fine. You can make him a mitzvah. There's a I have a sh for you. What happens if people you're your everybody here with the Msiah is coming next week and you buried a mace with without situs. They're going to wake up and wear begged without a titus. What's going to happen? What's the is that a shil or not? Would you ask such a question? Plus asked that question. So maybe you should put sus on the m so that when he wakes up because we believe that he's going to wake up right now he's going to walk around without he's going to have to take off his clo you have to take it off doesn't have what are you going to do anyway what why do we pass so he talks about it he talks about it the people are not so and today so many people that are not they wear sus and he says on the one hand you shouldn't put on sites him because he never wore during his lifetime But you Yeah, but but then you'll be like the whole thing finally goes into this very interesting. Check it out. Why can't you sell to maybe this guy that has all the sweet that's full of the guy will take it and sell to the Jew? The says that it seems like he took it back. He said, "Wow, that's a good said, you're right. Don't just sell it to God. But if you make bread out of it, if you make bread, you could sell it to him for for that. Why? If you do it not in front of a Jew, then the Jew saw that it's a Jewish bread, so he'll go buy it from the guy. But typically speaking, a Jew won't buy bread from a guy. So that you could do just four more lines. If the wine says in our wine fell on the the grapes, you just wash it off. And it's if it has cracks in it, it's also because it penetrated the grape. How come this is different than grapes? Why is it when it comes to grapes, if it has a crack, it's also But when it comes to wheat, it doesn't need a crack, it's also because check out this wheat on the screen. It has a little bit of a cleft. It has a crack in it and it absorbs the the ra. Have a wonderful day. What time is she? Mat Shabz. >> No. What time is mave? >> 8 o'ab. Yeah. >> So 10 and 11. >> 10 and 11. My boy say 10:00 English. 8:00. >> It's great to be back. Mom, it's great to be back. >> Merit the of spreading Torah throughout the world.
