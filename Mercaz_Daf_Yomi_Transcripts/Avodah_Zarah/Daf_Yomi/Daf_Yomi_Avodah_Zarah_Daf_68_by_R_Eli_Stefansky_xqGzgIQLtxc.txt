I'll remind my son met him in Florida. He tells my son he wants to donate something to MDY that I should call him. I figured like a typical donation when people say that it's usually $180 and some. So I pushed it off a little bit. Then I called him up. He tells me he wants to sponsor the So I told him I can't accept it if he doesn't do the daf. What do you mean? I want to give it I said no you got to do the d first do the d then we'll talk and ly hasn't missed the day since and today he brought five people to the daf and he started he gave me a whole speech today about how you think that you're giving it's you receive back so they bring many more people to sponsor anonymous anonymous may If you're trying to donate money to MDY, you don't do that.

It's like I called him up. I said, "Listen, um, I want to come to Los Angeles, visit my son. I think we should get a a beer Airbnb. I figured if we do it, the whole shop is together." I said, "You'll take care of the food. I'll take care of the the Airbnb." He paid for the Airbnb. He paid for the food. Everything was Gishmak. You know, you got to know how to do it. At the end, I paid at moving to Alex. >> Yeah. Cannot. So now you just ruined it for now. The whole MDY. We got a house from Marshkinazi. We got the restaurants from Lilarian.

Since like Brock time. >> Before that. >> Wow. >> I think it's end of >> No, it can't be because we weren't online until until the beginning. Similar similar time to Rabbi David joined together. >> Right. So that's all the way in the beginning. Yes. From for sure from way before braas. It's a big to have you. We once wanted to interview you and then you ran away something. So okay we interview you now 3 years later. So look at your son your grandson Yud. You said your name is. >> Yeah. >> Yudi. Yudi. Okay. Sakas. We got to learn to Dan Rubenov. My grandparents yard. >> Talking about someone has trauma. When you say hello cats in honor when you go, Dan Rubino starts shaking. Nelson cats in honor of Ellie for all he does for Thank you. MDR. It's not so funny. I'm saying the truth. Okay, here we go. Take you take this kind of vinegar. Check this out. If you look closely, look at this vinegar. It's made out of grapes, wine vinegar, but also has wheat. It's clay vinegar. It's a terrible vinegar. You take this vinegar and you pour it into your wife's cake batter. >> Is Is the cake kosher or not kosher? What is that called? You put in a bunch of vinegar into a cake. Let's make it also. Yes or no? Mut also. What's do you say? >> Okay. >> Here's another thing. Here's here's another sh I have let's say you have klaw. Anybody like klelaw hair like the New York the you remember? I know 30 years ago was kapanach. Today it's something else. Katners what's it called in Los Angeles? Essex and Con. >> Yeah. Essex and Coni. >> Was it called in Los Angeles? The deli over there. >> Talking about the from before brahas. Wow. >> So get him a seat. Get him a seat. We have one seat left over here. I'm not joking. >> Come to be that seat. >> The co the co. >> Who's sitting over there next to the rav? Somebody sitting here. Okay. You can sit right over there. No, no. Here, here. Also, come closer. Come closer. >> So, here's the my sh of the co is as follows. Klaw needs a gishmak vinegar. >> You put this non-coosher vinegar into the colelaw. Now, it's super super gush. I used to go to kapanach 30 years ago. I don't know what it is today in Flatbush and there was lines of people just getting klaw. You dump colaw into those jars. What? >> Right. Right. Right. Marina the Ray. That's the Anyways, the Klaw was, you know, Sham Do back in the day. >> So, let's say you put in this tray for Klaw Tra vinegar into the Klaw. >> You know what Klaw is? Yeah. You know, >> how about you guys from where who the guys from Manchester? They I don't know if you guys know what Klaw. They have it over there. >> They have. >> You could tell we eat a lot of kleslaw. Who doesn't? It's full of mayo. It's gishmach and sugar and milk. Yeah. So >> you take this tray for colelaw and you put it on the fire and you you boil it up until there's almost no vinegar left in there. Is it kosher or not kosher? So that's basically today's sug if you it's I'm sorry not it's you made a good co and then you ruined it does the does the is go out or not that's the today's sh basically that's what we're going to be dealing with if to begin with you added vinegar into the cake that's gi you started off on the wrong foot you use the iser for something not positive it's not positive to put vinegar in a cake. So it should be kosher not tra even though the ingredient is trafe but you try to ruin the cake. So it's kosher and the opposite if you put it in and for 5 10 minutes the kleslaw was really really good. So you had a klaw that was tra now that you put it on the pot and you try to get rid of the is you boiled it up you made it disgusting. Perhaps the is shouldn't go away. That's the regular. Let's see if anybody argues on that. So says four lines from the top of if you put the vinegar into the co or in the gar's case where you put the vinegar into a bunch of beans. Check this out. You put the vinegar into the cold beans. You can see the pot over here is frosty. It's freezing cold. Take it out of the fridge. You put the the the vinegar in there. It makes it taste good. It's good. And then you boiled it up. So you made it bad. That's where we have a says. We have to understand what the logic is. Why should this be mut for five minutes? It was completely awesome. I put the a bad ingredient in there. Wheat the this wheat field vinegar which is clay. It's a mixture of wheat and wine. So this is look at these little beans. They're all excited. It's they have muscles. Everybody's excited. And then he takes this frosty pot, puts it on the flame. >> I don't Yesterday they had tears. I couldn't get the tears to come back. I don't know what happened. Seriously. So, this is this is the right over here. But what happens if you put a bunch of vinegar into the cake? It wasn't even good for a moment. Or in our case, let's see our case. our case, he put the vinegar in when it was boiling hot, so it's terrible. Maybe these guys cry. Oh, these guys cry. Oh, call. You didn't accomplish anything with your tra. Your tra just caused problems. It was never a good thing. It wasn't like for five minutes it made the food better. The moment it hit it, it made the food terrible. Here's another case, just an interesting case. We could be magnitud. What if you have sourdough, you put in kosher yeast, kosher starter and it rises to perfection. So, we have a great great dough. Then you go ahead and you put in Truma starter. What's going to happen now? It's it's it's a good dough. And now it's going to make the dough a little bit too sour. It's a little bit of a problem. Is that considered a problem right away or that's considered that it was good and then became bad? What do you guys say? >> It's a little confusing again. What happened? >> Is MSA made it bad? >> So what is that called then? It's it's bad right away. >> So you're saying it was good and then bad. No, that's considered bad right away cuz you had No, you had a good food and your tra made it bad right away. I I figured it's going to be a little confusing. You hear? >> Yeah, it was at perfect. It was at perfection. My dough was at perfection. It's a sour dough. All I need to do is put it into the oven. I come ahead and take Truma starter and add it to my perfect dough. The moment it hits my dough, it didn't make it good. It's already good. It's perfect. If I take coleslaw, that's perfect. It's the perfect kleslaw. I I could dish it out right now at $62 a pound in kapanache and I take a bottle of non-g good vinegar and I pour it in there. I add more vinegar. Did I make it good and then bad or I made it bad right away? >> I made it bad right away. >> The vinegar vinegar reacts on immediately here. >> But over here takes time. >> Okay, so it takes time. But did it make it good for a minute? >> Did it make it good for a minute? No, cuz it was already perfection. >> Didn't make it bad. >> It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter when it happened, but it never did good. The point is it never did good. It only did bad. Only did bad. That's the logic is >> straight into something which doesn't make it bad. Is it us? Yes. Make it bad. >> No, you have to cook it. You have to diss it. It has to something has them part of flavor. Either part of good flavor or bad flavor. This there's no in between. Over here it's perfect. Anything in addition to that is bad. Let's get there. I just wanted to get you ready for this. >> That's it. >> It's very simple. Anyway, let's go back there. This is like it's a Galica story. What happened there? I don't know what you can learn from it. It's asks a good took offense to this and he kind of insults him. That's our case of wine that fell into the lentils and vinegar that fell into the barley. It depends what what version of the article you're going to look at. It could be a type of a pee, a split pea or barley in Hebrew, Grecian is barley. The English calls it split pea. But the point is it's some sort of bean. You add this vinegar to it also. It makes the food understands this to mean this is something that's detrimental to the food. Why? Because we're talking about that it's hot and as soon as you put the vinegar into hot, it makes it bad. Nevertheless, we have a Why do you say that in this case where it's hot and you introduce vinegar to it, it makes it bad immediately that it's filter over here. I have a what's going to tell him that it was hot. Maybe it was cold and it was good for it. Maybe it started out good and then bad. He insults him. You have no idea what you're talking about. You don't know how to learn. So you've asking me a you don't even know how to learn. Learn how to read first then come back to me. The truth is was wrong. Rivago was right. That's the end of the story. At the end of the Gimar, you'll see the Gar kind of agrees with the insult was given. The doesn't discuss the insult. It's just as he had to put him in his place. Listen, you don't know how to learn. You got the story wrong. It was this. First he put it into a cold pot and cold is good for it. So since there was a moment of of >> of an improvement, thank you. of an improvement the So that's it. The trafe product did what it needed to do. It worked. It caused the the food to be trave later on. You went ahead and you boiled it up. Okay. So you ruined it. I got to tell you this. Let's say you're in the middle of learning. You go you go home and you want to be part of the anonymous raffle. So you do you start learning the So what happens? You get a ding ding. What's the first when you get a a little ring on your phone? What's the first thing you do? So I don't know what happens in the brain. I once read about it. There's endorphins and you got a message. You got to see what it is. It's a good it's an email. It's an important email. So you right away take a look. Well, there's a WhatsApp and you take a look at the WhatsApp. Kaz says, imagine this. Imagine if a person wants to make a overnight soup. This is something I learned when I was a caterer that and I I asked last night everybody. Yeah, Vada. I didn't know this that if you boil a soup for like 24 hours, it's that much better than a soup that's on the flame for 3 hours. Not only that, if you put in the fridge and you it cools down and then it's even better. Guy wants like a ch like a ch. It's not just it's not just ch. I didn't know that. Okay. She bought her cater the t the soup tasted better and we like we cooked it up like before Shabas. I don't know why. So >> serving leftovers >> says overnight >> these guys that got married there they already have children that are married. Most of the people that I do for anyway. Yeah, now they know. Says, "Unbelievable." He says, "If you need a heat up this soup, you have to leave it on the flame for 24 hours. What if every 20 minutes you turn off the fire for 20 minutes? You had 24 hours of fire. It's nothing. Nothing's going to happen to the soup." says that if you learn Tyro and every six minutes you look at your phone and WhatsApp he says he says in fur WhatsApp email you're not you're notif so it doesn't work as well idea is to shut off your phone for a little bit and go I'm just I'm talking to Benny to Noam and to Marshkinazi and Klein these are the four people I'm talking to stop bothering me And if the phone is off, the phone Why are you looking at me like that? >> It's just better to do it so you see it. >> You mean when else? No, they're right. They're right. Keep on doing it. If I turn off the phone, I turn off the phone. He says, "Okay." He put first put in the cold, then he boiled it up. That's a classic case. We have good coleslaw and then you you boiled it up afterwards. It's too late. There was already five minutes where these beans were very they benefited from this vinegar and the fact that you boiled it up later doesn't help us out. Okay. This is Unbelievable. If I had this case, I take hot beans and I introduce them to the vinegar. What's going to happen? The moment the vinegar hits, it ruins the whole dish. Nevertheless, says and we have to understand this. >> There's a that's going to say that it's aer he's going to say even in this case the food is and he learns it from where? He learns it from from midy that the says you have to take their kale and and do kale even though it's disgusting even though it's ruined stuff. is even when it's bad. [Music] When it's there wasn't even a moment of benefit, it made a ruin the dish immediately. And he stops over there. He says three words. When the dish is bad from the first moment, now let's be medic. What about if it wasn't bad from the beginning? It was good in the beginning. The vinegar made it great. It's colelaw. Put in vinegar. Oh, it's great for 10 minutes and then you ruined it. This shouldn't be a Everybody should agree that that's 100%. It was good for 10 minutes. But doesn't explain. He stops right short. perhaps both have I don't know didn't say on the one hand you could be mad he said only when it's ruined all the way in the beginning but if it's not ruined in the beginning it had it was excellent food for five minutes so the the tra accomplished a ton it made this thing good should be awesome according to everybody know Even in that someone says that it's going to say it's so we have a here that's a big repress and says wait a minute just finish the what do you mean at the end of the says that everybody agrees that if it was good for a minute a minute and then it became bad. Everybody agrees that it's that's unbelievable. But in Bish they had a problem. They didn't know what it was a two times in the entire that is not a this is one of them. >> So oh what does have to do with it? I said the two times shouldn't be in a safe. It's not a real tu. It's not a real. >> Oh, but it doesn't say it. I looked here. It says on top. These are these are questions that are not. Okay. Now it's a take off. You ask him. >> You got to ask [Music] this amazing that just said that what that even though the vinegar was introduced at a terrible time when it ruins the dish nevertheless we consider this dish trafe holds it's tra says that such a big exist and we don't see it in a we don't see it in a anywhere How's it possible? Where did you come up with this? There's a famous story with Cutler. He was at a shabas of a of a one of the his from Lakewood and the guy gets up as a does and he gives a whole dr and was very uncomfortable. Everybody saw that he's like fidgeting and finally he screamed Aria Aria screamed. >> He screamed screamed. bring somebody just sent me a Galdica thing. It was a Gisha, one of the the talk show hosts >> this morning. I'm not going to mention his name cuz it's a >> but a famous famous talk show host. I don't think he's alive anymore from it. So he says, "And our next guest is so his sidekick screams out, our first guest." Like not a sidekick, one of the guys working there. She looks at him and goes, "You just corrected me in front of millions of people." >> Johnny knows Christmas bonus. Like anyway, >> I'm going to cut your pay now. >> I'm getting a bonus. >> You just got to get a bonus. >> Okay. Anyway, scream. >> Don't scream. Anyway, fine. So, bring the what you're saying that mayor holds that even if you introduced the vinegar all the way in the beginning and it and this food was terrible because of it, still where is himself took it upon himself to look through and find the source for this and he found something says in the Mishna Here we go. We have two starters. One is it says over here on the thing if you want to see. You see what it says? Rebansky starter. I guess that's me in earlier days. The waistline was a little different. The ses are the same. So step number one was we have we have three cases. one. We have one that the went in first, then the Truma. We have another case that the Truma went in first, then the And what's the third case? >> So, let's think what happened over here. The went in. So, it's perfect. You hear Ary? >> This is perfect. And now we added Truma. What happened? The Truma made it bad. The Truma made it bad. The Truma didn't make it good. It was perfect without the Truma. Kad has enough perfect amount to starter to make this batch yaldic. You add another one. I didn't ask my wife, but I guess you ask around it. The gar says I don't have to ask her. You add more starter, it makes it more sour. It makes it off. So, made it bad. So, here here's the ray that this is the case that we're talking about putting vinegar into hot beans, making it bad to begin with. What's tricky here is that it was good to begin with, but the beans were also good to begin with and and then you add the vinegar and then you you make it bad. The point is the bad stuff, the non-cooser stuff or or the user stuff. In this case, Truma is also for the the Israel to eat. When you introduce it, it's not helping the dish. It's ruining the dish. So that's called >> Why? Because it's Truma. >> Yeah. >> Truma for me. For us. >> Vinegar. >> Okay. >> No. For us. >> I mean, it's good for >> Yeah. Yeah. But for us or okay, you're better with and it has its own power to make it sour, to make it um how do you say in English or whatever. It makes it here. I found something in says since he introduces the truma it and the clay it makes it off right away yet holds that it's awesome what does say imagine if this woman whose husband didn't know and introduced the truma she could go ahead and sell this dough now it's double strong. Now she could sell smaller portions after Pes to all the people that threw out their starters. I told my wife, you got to throw out the starters. It's like g I can't have g in my fridge. I don't know of more than starter, right? That's the biggest. It's sar. That's what the call s. So after after pes, she went and she bought sar from the lady that didn't throw it out. I mean, she had to have starter. Where do you get started from? But Huh? >> Right. Right. For us, it's not a problem. It's her problem. Yeah. Yeah. He's 100% right there. So, so, so what does the Gur say? The is saying that the true, you hear, you're going to miss the point there. The truma is beneficial cuz you just made a stronger starter. You're right. The dough is terrible. Throw out the dough. But don't throw out the dough because I could use the dough for other starters. People going to come to me and give them starters all day long. I have enough starter for who knows how long. >> So now we're going to do the same thing over again. The same thing we just learned. We're going to repeat that. If when you introduce bad food, bad is vinegar into hot beans, he says it's still it's still. So this is another case here. You want to see it? Both of them together. You see so much different things happened since he left. It's unbelievable. Oh, that's nothing. Wait, wait, wait. We got some things have really changed. It's like three day. You going to get the glasses soon? See, there's enough in each one to make the dough sour. And they made it says Rashi more than necessary. They ruined it. That's mim says no. I'll tell you why it's because the truma made it bad and therefore the whole the whole dish is kosher. And if the truma fell in first like so so what's this? What is this called? When the Truma falls in first, it's good for it. It's it's right away. The Truma made it good. It had for sure. Okay. So, this is our right. This is what we spoke about a minute ago, but it's a it's something else. Case number one, where the fell in first, the Truma fell in second. What does the truma do? Makes it bad right away. Here we have a says that it's also over here. You see that when you introduce the truma at step two, the truma is ruining it. Yet somebody says that this food is awesome. What's going to be the answer? >> Huh? Anybody? >> That it's a great starter. You can just sell the starter. He didn't ruin it. He made it good. You'll say, "No, he didn't make it. He made the dough bad, but he made a great batch of starter." Okay, great. So, I'll I'll bring you from the the end of that. So, just remember this brace has three parts. This is the the last part. We'll go through the three parts again, but it's also something that we learned. What's awesome here? I'll do the spans in a second, but I just want to show you what somebody uh Shakar threw this in. This is Sorry. This is vinegar that fell into the cold the cold beans so that the gumar understands the pog. Sorry, I shouldn't have showed it now. I should have showed it in a minute, but you guys get it. The understands in the beginning that the vinegar comes and ruins it right away. Why? Because it's on the fire already. And if you'll tell me like that first it was cold and then it was hot. So in other words, it made the food good and then it made it bad. That's why say there is no in other words is wrong over here is telling you that is wrong say is there anybody that holds that if it was good for 5 minutes that the trafe made this food good for 5 minutes that it's not considered trafe of course it's tra how are you going to get the tra out of it when it was good the trafe made the food great I introduce vinegar to cold beans it makes the beans great and then he put it on the flame You made it bad. We learned if the Truma fell into the dough first and everybody here was in agreement that if Truma was number one, then the Truma is the one that made the dough and therefore what? Even if you add the afterwards, it remains. There is no argument in that. You're wrong. You shouldn't have made fun of. So you see over here like again that what is when the vinegar even in a case it's pel even in a case where the beans are on the fire and I introduce the vinegar to it and I ruin the beans right away. There's a man the Omar called Romeor who says this food is awesome I it doesn't make sense logically what the the trafe made my food bad not good why should it be tra it's bad let's say what >> cuz he he has a puzz the the disgusting kalin of the guy that are full of four day old pork in the walls and do so you see that even Oh, end the story. That's the end. Now it gets easy. It wasn't that hard. But turning of the global specialist in international financial services anonymous anonymous and gratitude to rebellion for promoting is there's a new one promoting. Look around in this room. I was worried that you're going to leave us. How you doing, Ellie? No, you Ellie. We have with their hats. We have with their keepas. We have litfac. We have all sorts of people. Huh? >> No, their type of keepa. And we have people that shave on ones that don't shave. All types says the We just read three cases in the in the and we need to know why do we need three cases? We're going to go through them here. The ratio is when you introduce and truma simultaneously. That's the hard one to understand. Why do we need that one? that should be included in the in the then we have the mitsia which was that you introduce one before the other for argument sake to make it easier we're just going to go to one case and that's the important case the other one is notesh we introduce shuma first so made the food good it made the dough the truma the is made the made the dough and then you introduce another one >> okay and then we had a third case where you introduce the trafe and it makes it bad immediately. The middle case is where it makes it good and then becomes bad. The last case is where it makes it bad immediately. Ask the gor why do I need a case where it happened simultaneously? I already know from the safa that if I make it bad right away there's a mand that says it's still tra. So of course if it happened together and it it actually made it good for a little bit then of course it's awesome the saf is the biggest possible even if the tra makes it bad you introduce manure to to food it's strafe you say what are you talking about it's disgusting no it's tra so certainly in the ratio where there's a little good going on and it made it it made it dope for 2 minutes so certainly it should be awes If if it's beneficial for a minute for 10 what? Oh, maybe we're maybe we're talking about that also. Yeah, you have a good point. So says [Music] where the wine fell in and made it terrible right away. Here I'm just adding that those words to it. It teaches a tremendous that even when it be if it wasn't good for a moment says it's what I'm going to do with the middle one even in the case where I introduced the truma first and the dough was perfect for five minutes and then I introduced another one everybody agrees in that case okay but what I need the first In the last case where I introduced the wine and I ruined the dish immediately on the first second I ruined the dish mayor holds is still so certainly what happened there I used starter from starter from truma the truma obviously helped out over here it made it a dough yeah you're right after 10 minutes it made it bad also because it's too much starter but at one point the dough was perfect 5 minutes in the dough is Perfect. 10 minutes in it was too sour. But for those five minutes, it made it good. So of course it should be according to this told it should typically take a dough to rise to become leaven. It should take two hours. Sir, >> so Europe should agree that it should be a ser. >> Yeah, this is mish a case of this is a case where it was good. >> It was good. The the the truma made it good. It made it dough and then it became bad. So you should agree rib shim that it is also. So what does tie in a bag? It was never the the Truma never had a chance to make this by itself. It never made it. It was in conjunction with the So the Truman never accomplished anything even for a moment like he was asking maybe do two of them together. So the Truma did do it. You're right. You need the whole time but the together to make it also [Music] ask. >> Huh? >> I skipped they both right. They both they both caused this dough to leaven and the truma never had a chance to make it by itself. It always needed the truma as the nevertheless it should be also why is so what if he it needed help but it should combine with the good and the bad and and it should make one is and we we're going to see more of this in a second to explain it. Check this out. Look at this. Could anybody guess what the grape on the left is? If you weren't here in cheer yesterday, what's the grape on the left? There's two grapes. >> Arlo. Very good. And what's the grape on the right? >> You have wheat and grapes together. So, we have two different. One is the Iser. One is the grape is. If you know the answer to this, don't answer. >> Only if you don't know the answer, try to answer. Yesterday we were talking about to beam tra is one out of 60. How many grapes do you need to be ara? How many grapes? How many more grapes? 60. If you know the answer, don't answer. I see you might know the answer. How many? You know, Rabai, guess >> 199 >> 99. You're wrong, but you're right. I think you're wrong, but you're right. >> I think it's 200 to one, but you're right. Cats is right. He did he did ch a bunch of times, so he knows it's one and 200. He said 199. He was off by I I I think that it's 200. No, you asking to me. >> Okay. What? >> 200 to one. >> 200 to one. That's the 200 to one. Okay. You You get it? If I If I had to give a prize now, you'd win the prize. But we have to be we have to be okay. How much do you need to be clay? The grape on the right the the client one how much also 200 to one question. If I have a box of grapes 300 grapes and these two guys fell into the grapes 300. >> What's is are they or not? simultaneously. >> The question is for each one you need 200. You need 200 for the ara, 200 for the clarab. But they're not if time out. Let's let's go back. Two ar grapes. How many grapes you need to v two ara grapes? What's the answer? 400. >> Two clayarium grapes. How much do you need? 400. So what if you have one clay and one ara in 300? Is that enough? >> No. >> Why not 200 for each? >> This one has 200. This one has 200. two different sur one >> time out. If I have one kaz of of of of neo in a ch and one kaz of clarum in the ch how many kazin do I need to be in vat 60 should be vat both because the different right okay so that's the question here >> one and then >> here hold on what do you say the what >> I'm saying if you if one goes in >> no okay but but it's not true because at every given time you need it's not battle right away check this out real quickly. You have the clarim and the guys >> in a 300 basket is what? So says that even if you have two and a you don't need 400 300 is enough. You hear what's going on here? 300 is enough according to they're individual 200 correct 200 I threw out 300. It's not. So if in this case then certainly not in when you have a true they shouldn't combine together to make it um >> similar. >> Yeah. Yeah. He said [Music] >> what >> 199 and two graves each one is 200. >> That's the case we're talking about. Who said this is two? >> It says 200, but we're talking about 199 and then two. >> You're asking if dad should be. I don't know if that's the case. >> I'm not sure. I'm not sure about that. Okay, I hear I hear >> if you're right, you're right. He's saying it's talking about a case of 199 grapes and then you have two. One is a cla care. One is Okay, we got to go quick cuz it's only a mouse fell into a barrel of beer. We have a video here. Where was it? Um, here we go. Two fell in. [Music] So a mouse fell into a barrel of beer. Now points out and this mad they didn't know this the guys that did this AI but we would die afterwards two mice fell in he pulled out one so says if a cold mouse falls into a cold barrel of beer what's >> no problem it's it's it's it's cold and cold so we have to say oh it's cold and cold it should be this is a new is like is like it's a cook. Okay. >> Now what >> the picture is still alive. It's alive. Give up any >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're not a lot of our pictures the whole tomb entire the guy's alive. Fine. It says like this >> Rabbi. Could anybody think of a reason why this beer should be? Why should beer? It's a dead mouse in beer. Why? Tell me a reason why it should be disgusting. >> It's disgusting. So, oh by the way, why is it called mouse >> mouse? Why is it called? Yeah. What is going to hold? That a bad flavor makes something we a bad flavor is. No, you're right. Typically in the world he hold everywhere he holds that a bad flavor is 100% mut. The whole thing of is a massive it's disgusting. Why in the world does the have to tell us you not eat a mouse? Of course, nobody eats mice. Without the you wouldn't eat a mouse. The is telling you that you shouldn't eat a mouse. meaning it's telling me that in the case of where it imparts a terrible flavor, it's also that's what is maybe if you're telling me that the shouldn't talk about at all that all it's that you can't eat them. So maybe the T is coming to those different kadesh that the reason the Torah says you can't have a shar you can't eat the sher it tells that even if it's dried out sheritt you also can't eat it that's also tremendous because we typically know that a shar has to be moist no maybe that's why the typically you people don't eat mice but even in a case where it's dried out says the don't eat it it's also in it's not but it's not why is it not because you have to say because people actually do eat mice. Here, I just got one picture off the This is like a a marketplace in China, right? They eat all sorts of gross things. So, people do eat mice here like this. They eat mice once in a while. But is certainly a mo thing. So maybe the over there is that it's even when it's dry. Why does it say it's not when it's dry? So what what are you going to say? The reason why even though it's only when it's moist is because it has to be something that's capable of it has to be like the moment it died where it was moist. Why is the mouth disgusting? Kings eat it, says Rash. You're not going to believe this. Look what Rashi says. A squirrel. We're talking about squirrels. We're talking about in in Hebrew. So, I have a video for you. I think you're going to like this one. That's all you [Music] I had a squirrel problem in Chicago in Lakewood and uh I bought a trap and I caught a bunch of squirrels. I was a as a good Jewish boy. I didn't know what to do with them. Now what? My friend told me that he released these squirrels miles away and they came right back. They were no they they they made holes in my attic. They they just climb up. They make a hole. So, what do I do? I call up my guy. The guy still works for me, Donaldo. I said, "Uh, come take care of the squirrels." No problem, Ellie. He comes with his little gun. Chick. And he takes him out, puts him in a plastic bag. And I'm watching him and he goes to his car with it like the garbage can is over there. Garbage can. I eat tonight. >> So, this they eat squirrels. There's a big oil. It's even I don't know. I I came to work. I was telling guys that that that of course I eat. Tim eats squirrels also. And he's not Yeah, people eat squirrels. >> You never saw a straight cat in China. >> Okay, we'll stop over here. A boy. Have a good Have a wonderful day.
